# Introduction to R Training

Courses and guidance provided by the [Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/) and ONS [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/) to help you get started with using R for data analysis.

The course was developed for those working at ONS and across the Government Statistical Service (GSS). However, we hope these resources will also be useful for anyone else who integrates programming and statistics.

There are several ways to access the course materials:

1. Navigate to the website (explained below).
2. Clone a copy of the repository to your machine
3. Download a ZIP file containing the website materials
4. Fork the repository

The training is covered by the Open Government Licence (OGL) giving you freedom to use the materials as set out in the licence tab.

These courses will be updated and maintained on an ongoing basis, should you come across any issues with the course or simply have a suggestion, please raise a ticket in the Issues tab and provide as much detail as possible.

# Course Website

The course website can be found at the [following link](https://datasciencecampus.github.io/af_introduction_to_r/) or on the About page of the Github repository.  It's recommended that you use this as the primary resource, however if you are experienced with Github and want a copy of the repository then use the methods above.
