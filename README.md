# Introduction to R Course Website

This repo has now been repurposed to host a Github Pages website hosting the ONS Introduction to R training programme.

Currently this is a pilot to demonstrate delivery of these materials through a new platform, making them open-source and more accessible.

Please note that the course materials themselves are still undergoing review with a release due in December 2024.
