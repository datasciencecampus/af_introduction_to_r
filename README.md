# General Information

This course will cover basic concepts and give you the confidence to work independently in the R programming language.  No prior coding or statistical knowledge is assumed, however you should be confident using basic computer software.

The course is split into chapters; each chapter will build upon the previous one.  It will emphasise the application of skills, building confidence and resilience in programming.

It is essential that you have frequent opportunities to practice what you have learnt from the course.
