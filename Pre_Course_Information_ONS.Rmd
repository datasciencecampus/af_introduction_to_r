## General Information

This is an introductory level course for Introduction to R. This course will cover basic concepts and give you the confidence to work independently.

In this course we emphasise the application of skills, and building confidence and resilience in programming in R so that you can continue to learn back at your desk. 

It is essential that you have frequent opportunities to practice what you have learn from day 1, as this is how you will embed your learning. 

The 2-day course involves practical exercises throughout and coursework which should be completed ready for the second day. 

There is also a session on the second day to play with your own data.

“Hi, Please can I have the New RStudio Bundle?

My ID is <your id>

“As agreed with Management, the new RStudio Bundle has to be installed to the end-user’ 

ONS Laptop”

Thanks”

### Set up R Studio

The [Wiki pages](https://collaborate2.ons.gov.uk/confluence/display/WIKIRS/1+-+RStudio+New+Bundle) (section 1.2) will help you to self install and run RStudio on your machine once your service desk request has been completed. 

Please email Mario Coluzzi if you cannot access this page, and with any issues you have with your RStudio install.

### Get Artifactory Hashed Password

Artifactory is used to store all available packages, and must be linked to your RStudio install. 

Visit http://art-p-01/artifactory/webapp/#/login and login with your Windows username and password. 

If this does not work, you will need to request access via the service desk – 

**I Want Something -> Software / Applications -> Product Support -> Artifactory -> Generic Support -> “In the further details box: Need access to artifactory to install R Packages”.** 

Once logged into artifactory, 

* Click your username in the top right hand corner.

* Enter your password again and press “unlock”.

* Press the copy icon next to the Encrypted Password (to the right of the eye, the icon looks like a pair of documents.

Now this is on your clipboard, it is ready to use in RStudio

### Running RStudio

* Double click the RStudio shortcut on your desktop, and press Open on the warning popup.

* Click Settings on the window that appears.

* Enter your windows username into the Username box.

* Copy your Hashed Password into the Hashtag box.

* Select R.3.4.0 from the New Library drop down menu on the right hand side. 
Press Save, and then, Run Application. 


**Note: Any time you change your windows password you will need to generate a new hashed password from artifactory and replace the old version by following the instructions for Get Artifactory Hashed Password and Running RStudio again.** 

### Old R Studio Install Instructions

This set up will allow you to download and install packages for R if you have the old RStudio install rather than the new bundle.

**If you load RStudio from your desktop you have the new version and can ignore these instructions.**

We do highly recommend that you request the new bundle of RStudio.

**You MUST complete all steps!**

* On your D drive create a folder called R,

* Inside that create a folder called lib, and open that folder.

* Copy the .Rprofile from here to your D/R/Lib folder. Save it as .Rprofile .
Make sure it has the dot at the front!

* In your start menu, locate RStudio, right click and pin to start menu.

* Open your start menu and right click on RStudio, then go to properties.

* Where it says start in delete the contents, replace with D:\R\lib and click apply.

* Go to http://art-p-01/artifactory/webapp/#/login, log in with your Windows username and password.

* Click on your user name (top right), retype your password.

* Next to Encrypted Password click the copy button (the clipboard).

* Now open the .Rprofile in notepad,replace username with your username and hashedPassword with what you copied from the artifactory and save.


**You need to always start R from the pin in your start menu.**
