# What is R?
 
An open source **programming language** and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

It provides a wide variety of statistical techniques (e.g. linear and non-linear modelling, statistical tests, time-series analysis, etc) that's why its often used by Analysts, Statisticians and Data Scientists.

R was initially written by **Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman** at the Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in New Zealand. It is named partly after the first names of the first two R authors.

***

## Benefits of Using R?

There are many programming languages on the market that one can use, but R is becoming very widely used. 

There are several reasons for this trend:

* Free and open source, people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
* Great Community Support, diverse and welcoming community. e.g. #rstats twitter community, numerous [ R Meet Ups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/r-programming-language/). 
* There are lots of [packages available](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) which contain implementations of processes and ready-made functions you might find useful
* Cross Platform, it can be used across a range of operating systems i.e Windows, Linux, OS.
* R has extensive and powerful graphics abilities. e.g [ The BBC use R to produce their graphics](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)
* Powerful tool for communicating results, i.e.. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)  makes its easy to turn your files into PDF'S, Power point presentations and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) allows you to make beautiful interactive apps and dashboards.

***

## R Studio.

R is a programming language that runs computations while R Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

You do not have to use R Studio to access R, and many people don’t!
Other IDEs that work with R include: - [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) -  [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-online/) - [Intellij IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-for-intellij)

R Studio is broken down into four panels for our convenience.



When we open R Studio for the first time, we’re likely to see this:

<br>


![](Images/studio2.PNG)


<br>

If you dont see the **Code editor pane**, go to the tool bar and click **View -> Panes -> Show All Panes**.

These can be adjusted under the ‘Preferences’ menu.

We will go through what we can do with each of these panels.

***

### Changing your R Studio theme

Before we begin using R Studio lets explore the various themes available, by going to **Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance**.

Choose a theme that works best for you and apply it.

*** 

### Don't save your workspace

Another setting we need to change is set R Studio to not save our workspace.

When you exit an R session, you are faced with the question of whether or not to save your workspace. You should **almost never answer yes**. Saving your workspace creates an snapshot of your current variables and functions, and saves them to a file called `.RData`. When you re-open R from that same place in your computer, the workspace will be loaded, and all these things will be available to you again. But you don’t want that, so **don’t save your workspace**.

>**We will look at better ways of saving our work later on during the course.**

To change this setting go to **Tools -> Global Options -> “Save workspace to .Rdata on Exit”** change drop down to **“Never"**.

<br>

> **R can be used as Calculator Exercise** 

***

### The Console

We are first going to learn about how to interact with the console, which is the bottom left pane.

This is where you can type code that executes immediately. This is also known as the **command line**. 

We’ll spend a little time practising running code in the Console by exploring some basic properties of coding in R.

To run code in the Console, you type your code next to the **> and hit `‘Enter’`**.



**Try out some arithmetic in your console**;

```{r}

2 + 4

```

We didn't just get 6, we also got [1]. This is R's way of printing to the screen; it's telling us the position we're at.

A semi colon allows multiple commands to be entered on the same line before processing.

Try and type the expression below and hit **`enter`**.

```{r}

23 - 6; 36 + 5

```

Note that if a **"+"** appears instead of the command prompt **">"**, this means that the statement you submitted was incomplete. 

Here **1 + 3 + **, is incomplete.

Typing the code below in your console, will result in a **"+"**.

We can either complete the expression or press `Esc` in our console to reset.


```{r, eval=FALSE}

1 + 3 +

```

 


The R Studio Console automatically maintains a ‘history’ so that you can retrieve previous commands.

On a blank line in the Console, press the **`up arrow`**, and see what happens.

The issue with coding in the console is that we cant save it and not easy to edit, which brings us to the code editor.

***

### Code Editor

This is the top left pane.

This is where you will do the majority of your coding, we will  be using scripts in this course.



***

### R Scripts

A **script** is just a text file which we write our code in, generally we will use them to write code which will be longer than just a few lines.

***
> **Creating a Script Exercise**

***

Lets create a script file which we will use to write and save our code during the course.

To create a new script,

**Click on File -> New file -> R Script** 

>**Alternatively you can press the short cut keys CLT+SHIFT+N**.

Scripts execute sequentially from top to bottom.

R Studio has the advantage of:

* Providing syntax highlighting 

* Assisted code completion

* Smart indentation

We will see the benefits of these as you type your code throughout the course.

**Lets practise writing some code in a script**.



There are three main ways to run code in an .R script:

* Highlight the line(s) of code you’d like to run and press **Ctrl + Enter**.

* Highlight the line(s) of code you’d like to run and click the **Run button** in the R script pane.

* To run every line of code in your file you can press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**.

Type the following in your script and run the code.

```{r}
print("R is the best")
```



Now try putting a space between print and ("R is the best"), What happens?

```{r}
print ("R is the best")
```

Now try entering "R is the best", What happens?

```{r}
"R is the best"
```

Now try capitalizing Print, What happens?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Print("R is the best")
```

<br>

Three things you have just learned

* R is case sensitive

* R does not care about whitespace

* R will print results by default

Its best practise to leave notes in your code to what your code is actually doing as code can get quite long and complicated and other people may need to use it.

We do this by using the **hash (#)**.


The **hash (#)** tells R not to run any of the text on that line to the right of the symbol. This is the standard way of commenting R code; it is **VERY** good practice to comment in detail so that you can understand later what you have done.Even if you are the only person to ever work on your code, it can be helpful to write yourself notes about what you were trying to do with a specific piece of code. 

>**Writing comments in your code as you work through the course is a great way to help reinforce what you’re learning.**

Lets write a note in our script.

Type the **#** and write yourself a note.


```{r}

# This is my first R script



```


If you think you’ll be writing more than one line of code, you can do a **hash (#)** sign followed by a single quotation mark (#'). This will continue to comment out lines of text or code each time you hit “Enter.” You can delete the #' on a new line where you want to write code for R to run. This method is useful when you’re writing a description of what you’re doing in R.



I  recommend to  save this script, type in the code as we go along, and only execute the required lines. That way you will have a record of what you have done.

To save the script; 

**Click on File -> Save as**

>**Alternatively you can press the short cut keys CTrl + S**.


We will now look at the top left pane.

***

### Environment/History

The Environment pane is very useful as it shows you what objects (such as; data frames, values and functions) you have in your environment (workspace).

Also in the Environment is the History tab, where you can see all of the code executed during the current session. 

This shows the previous code you were working on, and any storage of objects you are using such as variables, data frames.

We will look at these later on in the session.

We will now look at the bottom left pane.

***

### Files/Help/Packages

This shows the files, packages and help documentation.

This pane has a number of different tabs. 

The Files tab has a navigable file manager, just like the file system on your operating system. 

The Plot tab is where graphics you create will appear. 

The Packages tab shows you the packages that are installed and those that can be installed (we will look packages in details in Chapter 3). 

The Help tab allows you to search the R documentation for help and is where the help appears when you ask for it from the Console. We will look at this in more detail later on in this session.

*** 
We have now gone through all the four panes of R Studio, you should now have a basic idea of what each do.

For more information about R Studio, you can find the **R Studio** Cheat Sheet under the **Help -> Cheat sheet.**.

You will most likely be using data in R, we will now look at the different types.

***

# Data Types.

To get the best out of R, you will need to have a strong understanding of the basic data types and structures and how to operate on them.

Different processes apply to different types of data.

Different data types have different properties; if you try to add `1 + "two"`, you will get an error due to a mismatch of types.


First data type we will look at is numbers.

***

## Numbers

You will most likely want to perfom mathematical operations with numbers. Here is a list of some operators.

Operators in R:

<br>

|Operator   | Description     |
|:---------:|:---------------:|
|     +     | Addition        |
|     -     | Subtraction     |
|     *     | Multiplication  |
|     /     | Division        |
|       ^   | Exponents       |
|    %%     | [Modulo Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)|
|    %/%    | [Floor Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions)|


<br>

***
> **Arithmetic Exercise**

***

Let's have a play with some of these operators:



Type the code below,

```{r}

# This is my first R script

9 + 27.73


18^3 - 18**3


```

It’s also useful to note that R will follow BIDMAS for order of operations.

```{r}

# This is my first R script

10 + 11 * 12 / 3 - 5**2


```

There are also some built-in functions such as **sqrt(9)** or **round(3.6357, digits = 2)**. 

> **Functions are like commands they basically take an input do something and produce an output. You can think of them like mathematic functions, where you substitute in a value.**


Let’s see what they do:

```{r}

sqrt(9)

round(3.6357, digits = 2)

```

There are many more built-in functions which you will discover with more exposure to R, but for now we will move onto the different types of numbers we might work with. 

These are: 

* Double (dbl)
* Integers (int)


`Integers` are whole numbers with no decimal place. for example: …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, … and more, they are denoted in R by an `L` at the end of the number.

A `Double` is treated as the general number type and by default R will treat all numbers you use as double unless you give it an explicit reason to think otherwise. So therefore, any number with or without a decimal place will be treated as double unless emphasised otherwise.

We can see they type by using the **`typeof()`** function or command.

```{r}


typeof(10)

typeof(10L)



```

The next data type that we will look at is text data.

***
## Text Values

In R, we refer to text as 'character' strings. 

Character Strings are:

* Created using either single `''` or double quotes `""`.
  * For a string either single **or** double quotes must be used.
* An ordered sequence of character (or symbols).

```{r}

"This is a string"

```

A few symbols are awkward to get into character strings and this is because of they have an underlying meaning elsewhere. Generally speaking, a backslash prior to the special character you require will solve the problem. If not, Google will definitely have the answer!

For example, if you wanted to include quotation marks inside your string:

```{r}

cat("Then he told Skyler \"I am the one who knocks!\"")

```
We can do a lot more with character strings in base R such as:

* `substr` - create a sub string of a given string,
* `nchar` - returns the number of characters in your string,
* `sprintf` - formats a given string,
* `strsplit` - which splits a given string by a given sub-string or character

And many more. I encourage you to experiment with these.

***
## Logical or Boolean Values

In R these are written as `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

>> They are special R data types - not strings! So they don't need '' or "" around them.

They also have numerical value behind them - `TRUE` is 1 and `FALSE` is 0.

Therefore, we can treat them as numbers!
```{r}
TRUE + TRUE
```
And use all the other operators too!
```{r}
TRUE * 2.5
```

It's uncommon to use logical values for simple calculations like above. We are far more likely to deal with logical values when we work with logical (or conditional) operators, for example; to perform comparisons and checks.

Logical Operator| Description
:--------------:|:------------:
        <       | Less Than
       <=       | Less Than or Equal To
       \>       | Greater Than
       >=       | Greater Than or Equal To
       ==       | Equal To
       !=       | Not Equal To
      %in%      | Membership
       \|       | Or
        &       | And




Let's see how these work:

Is 4 greater than 5?

```{r}
4 > 5
```

Is 25 equal to 5 squared?
```{r}
25 == 5**2
```

Does 1 not equal 2?
```{r}
1 != 2
```

That covers the simpler logical operators. 

The final two allow us to combine and check multiple conditions.

Both `Or` (`|`) and `And` (`&`) have to have a condition on either side of them. They will check the conditions on each side and then return `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on their value.

`And` (`&`) will return `TRUE` if both conditions are `TRUE`, `FALSE` otherwise. 

`Or` (`|`) will return `TRUE` if at least one of the conditions are `TRUE`, `FALSE` otherwise.

We can surround the statements in brackets to make it clearer what items are being compared.

Let's look at some examples:

Can a statement be both `TRUE` and `FALSE`? 
```{r}
TRUE & FALSE
```
```{r}
TRUE | FALSE
```

Or a less abstract equivalent example:
```{r}
(25 == 5**2) & (4 > 5)
```
```{r}
(25 == 5**2) | (4 > 5)
```

***
## Data Type Conversion

Given that R is a dynamically typed language, sometimes the data type you want to work with, and the one R infers are not the same.

>> R doesn't require you to set the data type when you create it, instead it figures out what the best data type is for the object you are creating - numeric, character, logical, or others.

Sometimes you want to ensure that a particular object is actually a certain type, rather than leaving it up to R. This is done using data type conversion (or casting). R has a range of in-built functions that enable you to convert data from one type to another.

Firstly, the `typeof()` function returns the (R internal) type of any given object. e.g.

```{r}
typeof("is this a character?")
```

```{r}
typeof(5L)
```

```{r}
typeof(5)
```

We could equivalently use functions such as `is.` function which checks if our object is a given type. (set cursor after `is.` and hit tab).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is.
```

```{r}
is.integer(5)
```

The way we access the list of functions which allow us to convert from one data type to another we call the `as` . Let's see what we can do... 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
as.
```

```{r}
as.integer(4.996453)
```
***

# Variable Assignment

Variables are an integral part of any programming language. Variables allow us to store and label data under a specific name. It is like a place holder, used to store information. Think of it as a container, they main purpose is to label and store the data in memory.

R has a lot of flexibility when it comes to variable assignment. We can assign a value to name (or label) using `=` operator or `<-` and `->` operators. 

Here are a few examples of them in action:

* `x = value`
* `x <- value`
* `value -> x`

Where `x` is the variable name and `value` is the data being assigned to `x`. 

```{r}
x <- 25
```
After the assignment, to access or use the value we simply reference `x` in our code. 
```{r}
x
```
```{r}
x * 3
```

>>`<-` is the most commonly used assignment operator in R and therefore the one we will stick to. 

In R it is convention to use `<-` to assign variables and keep `=` reserved to passing key value pair to a function. We will be sticking to this convention. 

`->` is considered bad practice. This is because it makes it harder for others to see where a object has been assigned.

Variable names:

* Are case sensitive and must start with either  `_` or a letter.  
* Cannot use reserved words such as `TRUE` or `FALSE` which already mean something in R. 
* Ideally, should be descriptive, so that when someone else is reading your code they don't have to guess the relation between `x1`, `x2` and `zebra43`. 

Note: If you reference `x` (or any other variable) before assignment R will throw an error at us saying: `Error: object 'x' not found`.

If we ever want to reassign a variable we would simply use the operators above again. 

For example:

```{r}

my_int <- 5L

typeof(my_int)

```
```{r}

my_int <- "What?! A CHARACTER?!"

typeof(my_int)

```


Typing the following into the Console will list everything you’ve loaded into the Environment:

`ls()`


To remove a variable, we would utilise the `rm()` function of R. For example: `rm(x)` 

To remove multiple variables simply pass more arguments into the function `rm(x1, x2, zebra43)`

Alternatively, if you wanted to remove all variables in the environment we could use the following code:
```{r}
# Explore what it's doing
rm(list=ls())
```

***

# Help

Being a new user of R chances are you are going to get stuck at some point and will need help,Very few - if any - people in the world know everything there is to know about R. This means that we all need to look things up, these are some of the resources available.

## **Cheat Sheets**

You can access these by clicking on **Help** and then **Cheetsheets**.

## **R Documentation **{.tabset .tabset-fade}

### Example{-}

From within RStudio we can access the Help documentation by using ? or ?? in the console

Try and type the command below in the console,and you should see the Help panel on the bottom right side of your RStudio environment populate with documentation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

?mean 

or 

help(mean)


```
