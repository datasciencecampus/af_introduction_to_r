# What is R Studio Cloud

If you are having issues installing p R Studio or are having issues with installing package as a back up we will prompt you to use R Studio Cloud. This should be only be used as a temporary measure while you wait to desktop version installed.

A project has been already created called **Intro to R**.


When you access a project created by someone else, RStudio Cloud automatically creates a temporary copy of the original project for you. You can play with and make edits to it, but none of your changes will be reflected in the original. 

Save a copy of the project for yourself by pressing the **Save a Permanent Copy button**. Which is in the top right corner.
