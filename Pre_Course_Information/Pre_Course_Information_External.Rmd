# General Information

This is an introductory level course for Introduction to R. This course will cover basic concepts and give you the confidence to work independently.

No prior coding or statistical knowledge is assumed.

The course is split into chapters; each chapter will build upon the previous one.

You can see the course overview at the end of this document.

In this course we emphasise the application of skills, and building confidence and resilience in programming in R so that you can continue to learn back at your desk. 

It is essential that you have frequent opportunities to practice what you have learnt from the course.

# Install R and R studio


Please follow your departmental instructions for installing R and RStudio. 

Please ensure you leave adequate time for installation as this may vary from department to department.

***

<br>

## Set up R Studio {-}

This is vital for installing the packages we’ll use during the course. Packages are bundles of code and functions that allow you to extend the capability of R.

Your department may have its own rules about how you can download packages. 

Please ensure you’re aware of any local restrictions. For example, within ONS all our packages must be downloaded via an artifactory – you may have to request packages in your department. Please ensure you leave plenty of time before the course to have this actioned.

Packages we use during this course are

* tidyverse

* readxl

* janitor

<br>


## Installing Packages

***

### **Open R Studio**{-}

Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. 
Once running it should look something like:

![Image showing the pane layout in Rstudio](../Images/studio2.PNG)

<br>

If you dont see the **Code editor pane**, go to the tool bar and click **View -> Panes -> Show All Panes**.

***

<br>

### **Find “Console” Pane**{-}

By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio. Find that pane.

***

<br>

### **Installing Packages**{-}

To installs the packages, type **EXACTLY** the code below in the console and then press `Enter`. 


>**It is important we use this WHOLE line of code every time we install a package.**


```{r warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Installing packages

install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("readxl", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("janitor", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

```

<br>

>**Successful installation should finish with message as below, the last box.**

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Installing packages

install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("readxl", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("janitor", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

```
