# General Information

These instructions are for wider GSS Learners. ONS staff should use ONS instructions.

This is an introductory level course for Introduction to R. This course will cover basic concepts and give you the confidence to work independently.

No prior coding or statistical knowledge is assumed.

The course is split into chapters; each chapter will build upon the previous one.

You can see the course overview at the end of this document.

In this course we emphasise the application of skills, and building confidence and resilience in programming in R so that you can continue to learn back at your desk. 

It is essential that you have frequent opportunities to practice what you have learnt from the course.

***

<br>

# Pre-Course Check-list:

* Install R and RStudio on your laptop `(see instructions below)`

* Check your department's guidelines for installing packages. Some departments like **Home Office** should **NOT** install packages. If you are able to install packages `(see instructions below)`

* Save the data from the ZIP file to your hard drive in your working directory. `(see instructions below)`
  
* Ensure you have access too your laptop, charger, and your WIFI connector.

* In Person Courses - Please bring with you a water bottle, and a mug for hot drinks (not provided – however you have access to a hot water boiler. Please bring your own supplies) 

* In Person Courses - Arrive 10 – 15 minutes before the course starts to get set up and ready to learn

# Install R and R studio


Please follow your departmental instructions for installing R and RStudio. 

Please ensure you leave adequate time for installation as this may vary from department to department.

***

<br>

## Set up R Studio {-}

This is vital for installing the packages we’ll use during the course. Packages are bundles of code and functions that allow you to extend the capability of R.

Your department may have its own rules about how you can download packages. 

<style>
div.pale_orange { background-color:#dd4814; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; color: white}
</style>
<div class = "pale_orange">
<br>
If you are from the **Home Office** you will not be able to install packages directly. Please ensure you have installed all the relavant software from the software centre.

Please ensure you’re aware of any local restrictions. For example, within ONS all our packages must be downloaded via an artifactory – you may have to request packages in your department. Please ensure you leave plenty of time before the course to have this actioned.
<br>
</div>
<br>

Packages we use during this course are

* tidyverse

* readxl

* janitor (optional)

***

<br>

## Installing Packages

Again, please ensure you are permitted to install packages before following these instructions.

Departments like **Home Office** are not permitted to install packages.

***

### **Open R Studio**{-}

Once installed, RStudio should be accessible from the start menu. Start up RStudio. 
Once running it should look something like:

![Image showing the pane layout in Rstudio](../Images/studio2.PNG)

<br>

If you dont see the **Code editor pane**, go to the tool bar and click **View -> Panes -> Show All Panes**.

***

<br>

### **Find “Console” Pane**{-}

By default the console window will be on the left side of RStudio. Find that pane.

***

<br>

### **Installing Packages**{-}

To installs the packages, type **EXACTLY** the code below in the console and then press `Enter`. 


>**It is important we use this WHOLE line of code every time we install a package.**


```{r warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Installing packages

install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("readxl", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("janitor", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

```

<br>

>**Successful installation should finish with message as below, the last box.**

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Installing packages

install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("readxl", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

install.packages("janitor", dependencies = TRUE, type = "win.binary")

```

***

<br>

# Save the Data to the working directory

R has a powerful notion of the working directory. This is where R looks for files that you ask it to load, and where it will put any files that you ask it to save.

***

<br>

## Find your working directory.

In the R Console type `getwd()`

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE} 
# Getting the working directory

getwd()
```

This will display your working directory. For ONS staff this is likely to be
`"C:/My_RStudio/Workspace"`

***

<br>

## Download the Data from the Learning Hub

Access the [Learning Hub Introduction to R Page](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/course/view.php?id=538) and find the section called Data + Downloads.

Click on the top folder called "Data" and choose "Download Folder".

This will download a **zipped** file to your downloads folder.

***

<br>

## Move the unzipped folder to your working directory

When you open this folder you will see another folder called "Data" - this is an unzipped folder (it looks like a standard folder rather than one with a zip symbol)

Copy this unzipped folder (Right click and copy, or CTRL + C)

Navigate to the location you found using `getwd()`

Paste the unzipped folder to this location. (Right click and choose paste, or CTRL + V)
