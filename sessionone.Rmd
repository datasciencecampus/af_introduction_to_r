# Session One.

***
## Learning Objectives
**The goal of this session is to**

* Be familiar with R and R Studio.

## What is R?


R is a **programming language**, you can use it for statistical analysis, data manipulation and visualiasation.

R is an interpreted language. This means you have to type in commands written in R code.

**Why Use R?**

* Free and open source.
* Great Community Support, diverse and welcoming community. e.g. #rstats twitter community, numerous [ R Meet Ups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/r-programming-language/) 
* Lots of packages available.
* Cross Platform, i.e Windows, Linux, OS.
* R has extensive and powerful graphics abilities. e.g [ The BBC use R to produce their graphics](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)
* Powerful tool for communicating results, ie. [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)  makes its easy to turn your files into PDF'S, Powerpoint presentations and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) allows you to make beautiful interactive apps and dashboards.

## Using R Studio

R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools.

***

**Code Editor**
  -  This is where you will do the majority of your coding.
  
**Console**
  - This is where calculations take place, you can also code here, but not easy to correct.
  
**Environment/History**
  - This shows the previous code you were working on, any objects (Where values are saved in R), i.e variables, data frames.
  
**Files/Help/Packages**
  - This shows the files, packages and help documentation
  
  

For more information about R, you can find the RStudio Cheat Sheet under the Help -> **Cheatsheet.**

***

## The Console

Try out some arimetic in your console; type the expression and hit `enter`.

### Exercise, Basic Arithmetic. {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### **Questions** {-}
```{r, eval = F}

25 * 15


(76 + 94) ^ 3


97623 / 9


2 + 4 *
  

23 - 6; 36 * 5    
  

```

#### **Show Answer** {-}
```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, highlight.output=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}

25 * 15


(76 + 94) ^ 3


97623 / 9


2 + 4 *
  

23 - 6; 36 * 5 

```


Note that if a **"+"** appears instead of the command prompt, this means that the statement you submitted was incomplete. Here **2+4* **, is incomplete.

We can complete the expression or press `esc` in our console to reset.

A semi colon allows multiple commands to be entered on the same line before processing.

***

## The Code Editor

A **script** is just a plain text file which we write our code in.

You can type code and save it for later.

You can add comments to your code using **#**. R will ignore anything to the right of the **# symbol**.


### Exercise, Creating a Script {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### **Questions**{-}
Create a new script, choose a sensible name (e.g. intro.R).

Save your script **CTRL + S**.

Add a relevant comment at the top of your script.

Try out some arithmetic as before.

This time around to run the code you need to select the section you want to run and then press **CTRL + ENTER.**

#### **Show Answer**{-}

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#R can be used as a calculator

25 * 15


(76 + 94) ^ 3


97623 / 9


2 + 4 *
  

23 - 6; 36 * 5



```
***

## The Environment Window

Shows all the **objects** that you have created or working with.

We can assign these objects names, this is called a **VARIABLE**.

They are used to store data and can be changed according to your need.

Once an object has been created it will appear in your Environment window which helps you keep track of what objects you have in your current workspace.

We assign variables using the assignemt operator ` <- `,(short cut is **ALT + MINUS)**.

Assigning a variable provides no output. To see the variable, you need to call it. You can do this by running the name of the variable.

### Exercise, Creating Variables. {.tabset .tabset-fade}

#### **Questions**{-}

Store as a variable the **sum of 1 + 3**, call it **myVariable**

and another variable **2 - 4**, call it **another_variable**

```{r, eval=FALSE}

myVariable  <- 

another_variable  <-  


```

#### **Show Answer**{-}
```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}

myVariable  <- 1 + 3

myVariable

another_variable  <-  2 - 4


another_variable


```

**A note on Variable Names:**

Choosing variable names is one of the most difficult bits of programming; choose something that that is descriptive, recognisable. 

*camelCase vs. snake_case*

It doesn't really matter which you use, just be consistent.

Variables can not start with a number, symbol (except `_` ) or a reserved word like `TRUE`

R is case sensitive!

***

## Help

Working with R chances are you are going to get stuck at some point and will need help, these are some of the resources available.

**Cheat Sheets**

You can access thes by clicking on **Help** and then **Cheetsheets**.

**R Documentation **

By typing in the search box, you can also use the console to access help.

Try and type the command below in the console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}


?mean 

or 

help(mean)

?median 

or 

help(median)


```

**Stack Overflow**

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a great site to check if anyone has has a simmilar problem to you, and see how they got around it.

**Yammer**

Within Ons we have 2 groups on Yammer, 

* The **R User Group** which you can post any issues you are facing and people will suggests solutions

* The **Coding in the Kitchen** group which is used to share tips and best practice.


**Cross Goverment Data Science Slack**

[The Cross Goverment Data Science Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com/) is a place to talk to other people working with Data across government.

## Data Types/Classes

To get the best out of R, you will need to have a strong understanding of the basic data types and structures and how to operate on them.

Different processes apply to different types of data.

Different Types have different properties; if you try to add 1 + "two", you will get an error due to a mismatch of data types.

Some of R basic data types are;

**Characters - chr**

‘**need** to be surrounded in… **that is** how R understands **it’s** a character’

**Numeric - num (sometimes int/dbl)**

Numbers in R are grouped together. You may also see 

* int for interger (Whole numbers with no decimal place, they are denoted in R by an L at the end of the number.)

* dbl for double point floating number (decimal).

These different types exist in R for operations behind the scenes. We don't need to worry about them too much at the moment.


**Interger**

Whole numbers with no decimal place, they are denoted in R by an L at the end of the number.

**Logical,(also know as Booleans)**

Capital letters `TRUE` or `FALSE` or can be abbreviated to `T` or `F`

They are special R data types - not strings! So they don't need '' or "" around them.

They also have numerical value behind them - `TRUE` is 1 and `FALSE` is 0.


```{r, eval=FALSE}

Character example "ONS"

Numeric example 10.1

Interger example 10L

Logical example TRUE, FALSE



```




### Exercise of Data Types {.tabset .tabset-fade}



#### **Questions**{-}

What is the data type of the following?

```{r}

a <- "10"

b <- 10L

c <- 10

d <- TRUE

e <- "ten"

f <- "T"

g <- F




```


#### **Show Answer** {-}

typeof determines the (R internal) type or storage mode of any object

```{r}

typeof(a)

typeof(b)

typeof(c)

typeof(d)

typeof(e)

typeof(f)

typeof(g)


```

## Data Structures
We dont work with single data values, we often work with a combination or collection of data.

R organises these in certain structures.

This is how R stores data in a way that we manipulate and work with it.

Some of R data structures are:

- **Vector**

- **Matrix**

- **List**

- **Dataframe**

***
### Examples of Data Structures {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

#### **Vector**{-}
One dimension set of  data of the same type.

The **'c'** is very important.

Some in-built vectors, type code below;

**letters**


**month.name**

```{r}
Numerical_Vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)

Logical_Vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

Character_Vector <- c("Cardiff", "Newport", "Bristol")


```


#### **Matrix**{-}

Two dimensional set of data of the same type.

In other words, matrix is a combination of two or more vectors with the same data type.

```{r echo=FALSE}

my_matrix <- matrix (c(3:14), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)

my_matrix

```

#### **List**{-}

One dimension set of data, of different types.

```{r echo=TRUE}

my_first_list <- list(1,2,3,4, "two")

my_second_list <- list("ONS", 10, TRUE)

my_first_list

my_second_list


```


#### **Dataframe**{-}
It’s a two dimensiona collection of rows and columns of data, where rows are observations, and columns are variables. Also that unlike a Matrix, column data types are independent, each one can be anything.

R has lots of inbult dataframes you can access by typing **data()**


```{r paged.print=TRUE}

mtcars


```

***

## Operators In R. {.tabset .tabset-fade}

R has several operators to perfom mathematical and logical operations.

### **Numerical Operators**{-}

These operators are used to carry out mathematical operations.

Operator   | Description
:---------:|:------------:
     +     | Addition
     -     | Subtraction
     *     | Multiplication
     /     | Division
     ^     | Exponents

### **Logical Operators**{-}

The result of a logical comparison is a TRUE or FALSE result.

Logical Operator| Description
:--------------:|:------------:
        <       | Less Than
       <=       | Less Than or Equal To
       \>       | Greater Than
       >=       | Greater Than or Equal To
       ==       | Equal To
       !=       | Not Equal To
       \|       | Or
        &       | And    



#### Exercise, Logical Operators {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}{-}

What do think will be the result of the following comparisons?

##### **Questions**{-}

```{r, eval = F}

4 > 4

"Oliver" == "oliver"

6 <= 9

2+6 != 26

TRUE > FALSE

1 > 0


```

##### **Answers**{-}

```{r}

4 > 4

"Oliver" == "oliver"

6 <= 9

2+6 != 26

TRUE > FALSE

1 > 0


```
