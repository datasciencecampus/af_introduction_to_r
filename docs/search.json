    "text": "3.2 Global Settings Changes\nUpon first opening R Studio, you have the most basic form of the tool that has some of the most useful workflow features off by default. Let’s adjust these settings.\nFirstly, navigate to “Tools” and “Global Options”, which is where this tweaking takes place.\n\nYou see that R Studio can be heavily customised. You will only scratch the surface here.\n\nFirst, remain on the “General” menu and:\n\nUnder Workspace, untick “Restore .RData into workspace at startup” and change the drop down below it to “Never”.\nUnder History, untick “Always save history (even when not saving .Rdata)”.\n\n\nThe reason you don’t want to use these is that they are legacy ways of saving R code, and are not as effective or useful as more modern ways of saving your work, controlling coding logs with Git and so on.\n\nSecondly, navigate to the “Code” menu and “Editing” sub-menu:\n\nProvided you have R Version 4.1+, tick “Use native pipe operator |>”.\nTick “Soft-wrap R source files”, which prevents code continuation past the width of the editor pane.\n\nThirdly, change to the “Display” sub-menu, still within the “Code” menu:\n\nTick “Allow scroll past end of document” if you would like to be able to scroll past the final lines of your script.\nTick “Highlight R function calls”, as this is incredibly useful for distinguishing different R objects.\nTick “Use rainbow parentheses” as this allows you to distinguish between different layers of brackets, which helps with syntax errors.\n\nFinally, navigate to the “Appearance” menu:\n\nChange the font size to whatever is most comfortable for you, 14 works well.\nChange the help font size to whatever is most comfortable for you, 12 is a good default.\nChoose a theme that suits your preferences, many people prefer dark mode themes such as “Vibrant Ink” due to the code highlighting functionality.\n\n\nNow that you have R Studio set up, you will create an R Project to make management of your code simpler."

This is beyond the scope of this course.\n\n\n\nExercise\nCreate an R project in an existing directory, selecting the course_content folder provided.\nIn your own work, saving it one level higher in the root folder is a better approach. For this course, you must save it where you will save your scripts so the filepaths function correctly.\n\nAfter creating the R Project, it will open and set your working directory.\nWere you to share your folder with others, they can open the project file and everything will be set for them. This is a big step towards ensuring reproducibility.\n\n\n3.3.2 Re-opening the project\nDue to the changes you made earlier to the global settings, R Studio will be fresh each time you open it.\nSo how do you get back to your project?\nThankfully, you have the project menu in the top right, which allows you to:\n\nCreate a new project\nOpen existing project(s)\nClose projects\nSee recently open projects and jump straight to them\n\n\nFrom here, assume you create and save your scripts in this project in order for filepaths in Chapter 3 onwards to function.\n\nLet’s return now to R Studio, and discuss each of its 4 panes in detail."

    "text": "3.5 The Code Editor Pane\nThis is the top left pane, where you will do the majority of your coding. Often this is in the form of R scripts. A script is usually a text file which you write your code in, generally code that is longer than a few lines. It is recommended that you create a few of these as you proceed through the course.\n\n3.5.1 Creating a new script\nClick on File -> New file -> R Script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can press the short cut keys Ctrl+Shift+N.\n\n\nScripts execute sequentially from top to bottom, and give you the advantages of:\n\nSyntax highlighting, to identify code elements by colour\nAuto completion of code\n\nYou will see the benefits of these as you type your code throughout the course.\n\n\n3.5.2 Saving a new script\nIn practice, you would save your scripts in a specific folder. Each sub-folder of the root project would containing one type of file (R scripts, images, notebooks etc).\nThis is known as a tree structure, where there is a root of the tree, and the sub-folders themselves are the branches.\nFor this course, save your scripts in the root directory (where the .Rproj files are), this will ensure all filepaths for later chapters function as expected.\nTo save the script click on “File”, select “Save as” and choose a location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can press the short cut keys Ctrl + S.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Running code in an R Script\nAfter typing some code in your R script, there are several ways to run it:\n\nClick the cursor to the end of the line of code and press CTRL + ENTER.\nTo run every line of code in your file you can press CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER.\n\nYou can use keyboard shortcuts to diversify and speed up your workflow if appropriate.\n\n\n3.5.4 Example\nType the following in your script and run the code:\n\nRun line by line with Ctrl + Enter.\nRun every line with Ctrl + Shift + Enter.\n\n\n\"I am learning R\"\n\n2 + 4\n\n23 - 6; 36 + 5\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Commenting Code\nCommenting your code to describe functionality is an important skill to learn. It allows others to use your code in the future and can help you pick up code you haven’t worked on for a while. As with most skills, start small and build up your experience with practice.\nYou can add comments using the hash key “#”.\nThe hash (#) tells R not to run any of the text on that line to the right of the symbol. Keep your comments concise and to the point. Excessive comments can make code look cluttered and confusing.\n\n\nExample\nLets write a comment in your script.\nType the hash “#” and write yourself a note at the top of your script.\n\n# This is my first R script\n\nComments will be used throughout these course materials to highlight new concepts.\nAdd your own if helpful, or edit/remove any that don’t help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nComments can also be used to prevent R from running code that you don’t want to delete by typing a hash at the beginning of the line of code.\n\n\n\n# Comment out a line of code\n\n# 2 + 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlternatively you highlight line(s) of code and press CTRL + SHIFT + C to comment them out.\n\n\n\n\nMulti-line Commentary\nTo write more than one line of code, use a hash sign followed by a single quotation mark #’.\nThis creates a multi-line comment that inputs the symbol again each time you start a new line.\nYou can delete the #’ on a new line where you want to write code for R to run.\n\n#' This is a multi-line comment\n#' you hope you like the look of R Studio so far!"

This is quite different from other languages such as Python.\n\nAn Integer is a positive or negative whole number with no decimal place, such as -2, -1, 0, 1, 2.\n\nIn R these aren’t as widely used, but should it be required, you specify them using a capital “L” at the end of the number for R to recognize them as such.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Numeric Operators\nYou will likely perform mathematical operations with numbers. Here is a list of some common operators:\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n+\nAddition\n\n\n-\nSubtraction\n\n\n*\nMultiplication\n\n\n/\nDivision\n\n\n^\nExponents/Powers\n\n\n%%\nModulo Division\n\n\n%/%\nFloor Division\n\n\n\nLet’s have a play.

They are sequences of character data, usually used to store qualitative data.\nStrings are contained within either ‘single’ or “double” quotation marks.\nAll characters between the opening and the closing quote are part of the string.\n\n# Example of a character string\n\n\"Hello World\"\n\nThe choice between single and double quotes is up to the user, as long as you start and end with the same symbol.\n\nA note on quotes\nWhat you must be careful of however, is utilising apostrophes or quotes within a sentence.\nIf you must do this, you use one quotation mark to open and close the string and the other to type the quote.\nThe following code is incorrect:\n\n# Incorrect character string\n\n\"You should be proud of when you typed \"Hello World\" and ran that code!\"\n\nNotice that the syntax highlighting has told you that something is wrong, as the “Hello World” is outside of the string, since you used too many double quotes.\nHowever, if you switch to single quotes, this will work fine.\n\n# Correct character string\n\n\"You should be proud of when you typed 'Hello World' and ran that code!\"\n\n\n# Correct character string\n\n'You should be proud of when you typed \"Hello World\" and ran that code!'\n\nNotice that the outputs here are slightly different. This is because when inside a string, R needs to be sure that the character (such as a quote mark) is being used as raw text, as opposed to it’s other function as a way to create strings.\nThis manifests itself as a backslash \\ which is known as an escape character. It basically tells R to interpret the character that directly follows it as raw text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you forget to put quotes around something, you can highlight and press the quote key and it will add quotes to both sides."

This is acceptable in this case as sqrt() and round() are quite simple functions.\nHowever, functions such as round() can take more than one argument, many are optional and some have a default value that can be turned off and tweaked.\n\nA common example is when rounding, you would likely want to specify the number of decimal places to round to. This can be controlled with the optional digits argument.\n\nyou separate arguments within functions using commas, as follows:\n\nfunc(argument_1 = value_1, argument_2 = value_2,…)\n\nLet’s see an example of using multiple arguments with the round() function.\n\n# Round to 2 decimal places\n\nround(3.6357, digits = 2) \n\nYou must make sure that the argument name is correct (as defined by the function itself), otherwise you will get an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNotice that even without the digits argument, the round() function works.

It is the value assigned to the variable that determines the datatype.\n\n# Prove that the value is what determines the datatype\n\ntypeof(weight_kg)\n\nNow let’s do some maths.\n\n# Add 4 to your weight\n\nweight_kg + 4\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Creating new variables from existing\nYou can modify the value of a variable in some way and then assign that to a new variable.\nFor example, let’s convert weight from kg to lbs, where 1kg = 2.2lbs\n\n# Creating a new variable, converting the existing one\n\nweight_lb <- weight_kg * 2.2\n\n# To display the variable\n\nweight_lb\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Overwrite and reassign an existing variable\nIf you want to reassign a variable you could use the assignment operator again.\nLet’s assign your height as 5.\n\n# Create height variable\n\nheight <- 5\n\n\n# Display height\n\nheight\n\nUsing the same variable name will overwrite the previously assigned variable, even if you assign it to the same value.\nLet’s overwrite height to a different value.\n\n# Assign and overwrite height\n\nheight <- 7\n\n# Display new height\n\nheight\n\nYou can also assign variables using the = operator, but this is considered bad practice in R as it is used to give function arguments a value."

You can create a vector by using:\n\nThe combine function c() that we saw previously.\nThe sequence function seq() to create any sequence of numbers.\nThe colon operator to create a vector of consecutive numbers.\n\n\n3.3.1 The c() function (combine)\nLet’s create a numeric vector with c() this time!\n\n# Creating a vector using the combine function\n\nsample_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# To display the created vector\n\nsample_vector  \n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 The seq() function (sequence)\nA sequence of values has:\n\nA starting point\nAn ending point\nA “step”, a.k.a the value we jump by from number to number.\n\n\nFor example, if we start at 2, end at 10 and step by 2 we will have (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) as our final sequence.\n\nThe seq() function takes the arguments:\n\nfrom - the start point\nto - the end point\nby - the step value\n\n\n# Creating a vector using the sequence function,\n\nsequence_vector <- seq(from = 2, to = 6, by = 2)\n\n# To display the created vector\n\nsequence_vector\n\n[1] 2 4 6\n\n\nEarlier we saw in the console the number [1] next to our output. This represents the position of the element to the right of this number in the vector.\nThus, 2 is element 1 of our vector, 4 is element 2 and so on. This is essential information for later.\n\n\n3.3.3 The Colon Operator\nA range of values (i.e., consecutive values) could be generated as a vector using a colon : in R.\nSince this is consecutive, we can’t have broken sequences like seq() allows.\n\n# Creating a vector using a colon\n\ncolon_vector <- 6:10\n\n# To display the created vector\n\ncolon_vector\n\n[1]  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\n\nCreate two vectors, one with numeric data and one with character data and name them appropriately. For example favourite_movies, lucky_numbers.\nUse the c() function to create a new vector with your vectors as inputs. This combines the smaller vectors into a larger vector, further showcasing their versatility.\nFind the type of your new vector.

This is called coercion, which works on a complex heirarchy:\n\nAny datatype can be converted to a character by wrapping it in quotation marks ” “.\nAny integer can be converted to a double by adding in the decimal place, i.e. 1L –> 1.0\nAny logical can be converted to an integer or double as they have numeric representation as 1 and 0 (or 1.0, 0.0) in the background.\n\nHowever, a character such as “hello” cannot be converted to any other type.\nAs such, we have:\n\nLogical < Integer < Double < Character and we see that character is the most all encompassing, with logicals being converted from but not to."

    "text": "2.1 How functions work\nThe seq() function from chapter 2 is the perfect example to reinforce how functions work, as well as common pitfalls.\nLet’s take a closer look at the help file for seq().\n\n# Help doc for seq()\n\n?seq\n\n# or\n\nhelp(seq)\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Function help files\nEvery help file will have a series of sections describing what the function does. It is worth focusing on the description, the usage and especially the arguments first.\nDescription\nFor example, in the help file for seq() under Description, it tells us it is a function to “Generate regular sequences”.\nUsage\nWe can see that seq() takes the required arguments:\n\nfrom (which is 1 by default)\nto (which is 1 by default)\nby (which is calculated by default)\n\nand the optional arguments:\n\nlength.out\nalong.with\n\nArguments\nHere, we can find out what these arguments are:\n\nfrom, to: the starting and maximal end values of the sequence.\nby number: increment of the sequence.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Execution of function arguments\nWe used this function when creating vectors, here’s a reminder.\n\n# Creating a sequence of numbers\n\nseq(from = 2, to = 6, by = 2)\n\nLet’s consider what happens instead when we don’t specify the arguments, just their values.\n\n\nExample\n\n# Creating a sequence of numbers - not specifying arguments\n\nseq(1,10)\n\nThis has generated a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10. In this case we did not supply a value for by, so it took the default value, which in this case is 1.\nWhat if we flip 10 and 1 instead?\n\n# Creating a sequence of numbers\n\nseq(10,1)\n\nSo it is clear that where we place the value is important, because arguments are resolved by position, in the order specified in the help documnentation.\nSo above:\n\nIn the first example, it is assumed that we want a sequence from 1 that goes to 10.\nThen if we swap the numbers it is assumed we want to sequence from 10 that goes to 1.\n\nHowever, if we name the arguments explicitly using argument = value, the order we specify them does not matter.\nLet’s see this in action:\n\n# Reversing arguments but using argument name\n\nseq(to = 10, from = 1)\n\nYou can sometimes run into errors with more complicated functions by taking the arguments for granted.\nOften there are many optional arguments that are resolved (position wise) before the required ones.\n\nWe would encourage you to specify the arguments and parameters as it makes your code easier to understand."

    "text": "6.1 Readr\nThe package provides a fast and friendly way to read data from:\n\nComma Separated Value (csv) files\nTab Separated Value (tsv) files\n\nconverting them to tibbles, which are the required data structure in the tidyverse.\nLet’s formally introduce them now.\n\n6.1.1 Tibbles\nTibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviours to make life a little easier, R is over 20 years old after all:\n\nTibbles complain more when variables do not exist - leads to easier error checking.\nTibbles don’t change variable names.\nTibbles don’t tweak variable types from the source data.\n\nThe key benefits of tibbles are:\n\nIn addition to its name, each column reports its type.\nThe dimensions of the tibble are shown at the top.\nTibbles have a refined print method that shows only the first 10 rows, and all the columns that fit on screen. This makes it much easier to work with large data.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 How readr works\nThis package reads in datasets we supply by using a family of functions, ones that have the same prefix.\n\nread_filetype()\n\nThe most common, and one we will use throughout the course is read_csv().\n\n\n6.1.3 Considerations to make\n\nBefore importing your data you need to know:\n\n\nWhere it is stored?\nWhat kind of file is it?\nAre there missing values in the data?\n\nMissing values in R are denoted by NA.\n\n\nThe code will take the following form:\n\ndata_name <- read_csv(file_path)\n\nand readr will:\n\nAssume the first row of your data is the headings of the columns.\nAttempt to guess the datatype of columns, given their content. If a numeric column contains 99 doubles and one character, then the same coercion that happened with vectors will happen again (since columns are vectors) and we get a character column.\n\nOne of the first data checks you should do is that the types of the columns match what you expect.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Example - Our first filepaths\nLet’s load in the titanic dataset in the “Data” folder.\nWe need to figure out where this is and how to get there from our current working directory, so that we can tell R.\n\nAbsolute FilepathsRelative FilepathsLoading in the dataInspect Data\n\n\nAn absolute or full filepath is constructed as:\n\n“starting_drive/step_1/step_2/step_3/…./destination”\n\nthis details the full path taken to reach the file.\nTo reach “titanic.csv” the absolute filepath for us is\n\n“C:/Users/marshj1/af_introduction_to_r/data/titanic.csv”\n\nNote that your usernames and drives will differ to ours.\n\n\nA relative filepath is the path to reach the file relative to the current working directory.\nThus we are already part of the way there, and just need to tell R where to go from here:\n\n“working_directory/step_1/step_2/…/destination”\n\nHowever, in our case, our working directory is one level deeper than we’d like to be, in the course_content folder.\n\nTo reach the dataset, we must exit this folder to get back to the root, then enter the data folder, and select titanic.csv\n\nTo do so, we need to know how to go back one folder level, or exit the current directory, this is written as ../ where the two full stops denote going back.\nAs such, the relative filepath we need to reach the dataset is\n\n“Data/titanic.csv”\n\nVisually, to understand the tree-like folder structure, we have something like the following going on:\n\n\n\nLet’s read in titanic using a relative filepath.\nWe simply need to go into the data folder, then select the titanic.csv file to load in.\n\n# Read in titanic with read_csv()\n\ntitanic_data <- read_csv(\"Data/titanic.csv\")\n\nYou will get some information on:\n\nrows and columns\nCounts of each column datatype\n\n\n\nLet’s call the name of the variable we have created to see the output of our first tibble.\n\n# Display the titanic data\n\ntitanic_data\n\nNotice the refined print we get from this, that provides so much more information than the data frame output did in chapter 2.\nIt may take more time to read and understand, but prevents you from having to use many additional functions to find out things such as dimensions (rows and cols).\nAnother example of inspection is with View(), which opens a separate tab in the code editor pane with the dataset in spreadsheet form.\n\n# Viewing the data - Note the capital V\n\nView(titanic_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\n\nHaving read in the titanic data above, have a look at the column Age of passenger.\nWhat type of data would you expect this column to be?\nUse the “str()” function to see the data type R has set it to be.\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at the column Age of passenger.\nThe column looks numeric.\n\n\n\n# Using the str() function\n\nstr(titanic_data)\n\nWe can see that R has classed the column as character because of the . and asterisk within it.\nNotice how much of the information this provides is also represented in the tibble output, very impressive!\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Dealing with Missing Values at Read-in\nWhilst we cannot observe all missing values at this stage, examples that cause columns to be cast to unexpected data types are often spotted quickly.\nWe can easily correct this by adding the na paramter to the read_csv() function.\n\n# Specifying missing values as a vector to read_csv()\n\ntitanic_data <- read_csv(\"Data/titanic.csv\", \n                           na = c(\"*\", \".\", \"\", \"NULL\"))\n\nThis is read as:\n\nWhere there is the a full stop, asterisk, NULL (entirely empty) value or a blank space, class is it as a missing value.\n\nWe can now see that the . and * in the age column have been replaced with NA’s and the age column is now numeric.\nYou may see all sorts of missing values in practice, deriving from data entry:\n\nnegative numbers where it makes no sense\nabnormally large values such as 999999\n\n\nThere are many other useful arguments you can use when reading in data, check the help documentation for read_csv() for details."

    "text": "4.1 Rename\nWe may wish to remain within the tidyverse when cleaning column names (say, Janitor is not available to you), which invites the use of rename().\nThis allows you to change column names one at a time using the following syntax:\n\nrename(.data, new_name = old_name)\n\nAs an example, let’s rename the age_of_passenger column to simply “age”.\n\n# Rename the age_of_passenger column to age\n\nrename(.data = titanic_data,\n       age = age_of_passenger)\n\nIf we glimpse the data again:\n\n# Take a peak at titanic data\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)\n\nWe see that age has not carried through to the underlying dataset.\nThis is an excellent feature of the tidyverse, in that if we do not:\n\nDirectly overwrite the variable\nOr create a new one using assignment <-\n\nthen it just shows us what that process will do, so we can then make the decision on whether it’s what we want.\n\n4.1.1 Renaming multiple columns\nOne of the best things about dplyr’s functions is that the .data argument clues the function in to the columns themselves, which means we can just continually list them, or make changes to them, without wrapping them in a vector c(), like many other libraries.\nAs an example, let’s create a new variable and rename the “of_passenger” columns.\n\n# Rename of_passenger columns and create a new variable\n\ntitanic_renamed <- rename(.data = titanic_data,\n                       name = name_of_passenger,\n                       sex = sex_of_passenger,\n                       age = age_of_passenger) # Notice autocompletion\n\nglimpse(titanic_renamed)\n\nWe also didn’t need to give them in the order specified either, the function automatically knows what columns we are referring to in the underlying dataset.\nThere is much more we can say about the structure of these functions, but we will see this as we proceed through the verbs themselves."

    "text": "4.2 Arrange\nOur data is displayed in the same order as the source data.\nWe may want to sort our data based on specific columns.\nTo do so, we use the verb arrange().\n\n4.2.1 Example - Single column sort\nFrom here, we will only create a new variable or overwrite the existing one when a change we wish to permanently keep is performed.\nWe highly encourage you to do the same, as creating multiple new variables you will never use again will clutter up your environment.\n\n# Sort titanic by fare\n\narrange(.data = titanic_data,\n        fare)\n\nWe get a larger output here that does not show us all columns at a glance, so checking that the outcome is what we expect is more difficult.\nWe should instead use glimpse() to check the output, which needs to be written first in the code.\n\n# Sort by fare and then glimpse\n\nglimpse(arrange(.data = titanic_data,\n                fare))\n\nNotice that by default, arrange() sorted the fare column in ascending order.\n\n\nSmall Aside - Functions\nNotice that glimpse() is written first but executed last, since R evaluates functions from the inside out.\nAfter all, if glimpse() has no input, we can’t see anything at all!\nKeep this in mind as it will become very important later.\n\n\n4.2.2 Example - Desending Order Sort\nTo sort a column in descending order, we use the desc() function and the column name as its input.\n\n# Sort titanic in descending order \n\nglimpse(arrange(.data = titanic_data,\n                desc(fare))) \n\n\n\n4.2.3 Example - Multi-Column Sort\nWe can also sort by multiple columns, but this creates a chain of dependence, in that the first column sort is maintained before the second sort is performed.\nThis means that the second sort won’t change the order from the first sort.\n\nWhen this becomes useful is if there are numerous examples of the same value, such as the 0.0000 values in the fare column.\n\nWhilst the position of 0.0000 will not change, the values in the adjacent column will be sorted. Some of those paying £0 fare may have been younger than others, after all.\n\n\n\n# Multi-column sort\n\nglimpse(arrange(.data = titanic_data,\n                fare,\n                age_of_passenger))\n\nNotice that we were able to just continually reference columns from the data as if they were arguments to the function, and the verb understands that immediately, just like with rename().\n\n\n4.2.4 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\nSort the titanic data set by age in descending order, then fare in ascending order.\nGlimpse the result.\n\n\n\n# Sort by age desc, fare asc\n\nglimpse(arrange(.data = titanic_data,\n                desc(age_of_passenger),\n                fare))"

    "text": "4.3 Select\nSometimes we will want to work with smaller tibbles that contain just a subset of available columns.\nThe select() verb is perfect for this, and it takes the arguments:\n\nThe first is our dataset, made even simpler with “.data”\nFrom here we list as many columns by name as we would like to be retained in our selecting process.\n\nThe order in which we specify them is the order they will be in the smaller tibble.\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Example - Single Column\n\n# Selecting data\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data, \n                name_of_passenger))\n\nNotice that this has returned a tibble with one column, not the underlying vector itself that $ would have.\n\n\n4.3.2 Example - Multiple Columns\nIf we want to select multiple columns, we can continue to list them, separating with commas, as we did with arrange().\n\n# Selecting data\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data,\n                name_of_passenger, \n                age_of_passenger,\n                pclass))\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Example - Columns in a range\nWe can select consecutive columns (next to one another) with the syntax we used for indexing in chapter 2, the colon : operator.\n\n# Selecting from passenger class to the age of passenger in order\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data,\n                pclass:age_of_passenger))\n\nNotice that we return the columns from pclass to age_of_passenger in the order of the source data.\n\n\n4.3.4 Selecting with exclusion\nUp to this point we have selected with inclusion, a.k.a we specify the columns we want to include in our smaller tibble.\nThe real power of select comes from it’s flexibility, in that we can reduce the amount of code to write by using exclusion instead, a.k.a specify the columns we don’t want to include.\nSay we want to keep 7 of 9 columns, instead of typing out the names of all 7, we can just exclude the 2 we don’t want instead.\n\n\nExample\nTo exclude, we use the minus sign operator - which signifies “do not select this” or “select, not this”.\n\n# Selecting by excluding columns we don't want\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data, \n                               -name_of_passenger, \n                               -age_of_passenger, \n                               -pclass))\n\nThere is an even more streamlined way to do this, by wrapping the columns in a vector with the c() function and using one minus sign outside it.\nYou can think of this as expanding brackets in mathematics:\n\n-c(col1, col2) = c(-col1, -col2) = -col1, -col2\n\n\n# Using a vector for exclusion\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data, \n                               -c(name_of_passenger, \n                                  age_of_passenger, \n                                  pclass)))\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Selecting with Index Position\nWe can also select the columns using their index position, starting from 1, just like we did with data structures in chapter 2.\nLet’s select columns 1 to 4, and also column 7.\n\n# Selecting sequential and out of sequence columns with index position\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data, \n                               1:4, \n                               7))\n\nExclusion works similarly here with the minus sign.\nNote that whilst this may be required in some cases, it is usually better to be explicit with the exact column names, if possible.\n\n\n4.3.6 Select Helper Functions\nAs if select() wasn’t already helpful enough, it even has helper functions that allow us to select on specific patterns, such as a prefix or suffix in a column name.\nThey are as follows:\n\nstarts_with(match): Starts with a prefix.\nends_with(match): Ends with a suffix.\ncontains(match): Contains a literal string.\nmatches(match): Matches a regular expression.\neverything(): Selects all variables.\nlast_col(): Selects the last column.\n\nThese can be passed instead of column names and alongside selected column names as well.\n\n\nExamples\nLet’s return columns that start with an “s”.\n\n# Selecting columns\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data, \n               starts_with(\"s\")))\n\nAs a second example, let’s return everything.\n\n# Selecting everything\n\nglimpse(select(.data = titanic_data,\n               everything()))\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\n\nSelect the second, third and fourth columns from titanic_data, without typing all three.\nSelect all columns except “fare”, “cabin” and “embarked” from titanic_data.

    "section": "4.4 The Pipe Operator",
    "text": "4.4 The Pipe Operator\nUp until now, we have run verbs one at a time on our dataset, be it to sort or select columns.\nThe real power of the tidyverse comes from the ability to chain these functions together in a sequence for more complex data manipulation tasks.\nHowever, out of the box, this becomes laborious quickly due to the nature of functions.\n\n4.4.1 Returning to Functions - Composition\nAs we saw earlier with glimpse(), to apply many functions to a single output, known as composition of functions, we must nest them, with the function applied last being written first, and evaluated from the inside to the outside.\n\n\nExample\nFor example, let’s take the sqrt() and round() mathematical functions and apply them together, so that we obtain the square root of a number and hence round it to a specified number of decimal places.\n\n# Compose mathematical functions\n\nround(sqrt(2))\n\nNotice that the functions are evaluated in reverse order (from the inside, out) just as you would with writing this mathematically. You would perform the square root operation first, then round the result.\nShould we wish to use an extra parameter, we need to start thinking about the brackets, as they are the opening and closing doors of a function itself.\nThus, the digits parameter needs to go inside the round() brackets, not the sqrt() ones.\n\n# Compose mathematical functions with extra parameters\n\nround(sqrt(2), digits = 2)\n\nNotice that the input to the function round() was the output from the sqrt() function.\n\n\n4.4.2 Composition of functions in the tidyverse\nThis becomes tricky to comprehend when working with the tidyverse functions, as we are effectively performing actions in sequence, such as selecting the columns we want and then sorting the result.\nAs such, the output of one function is the input to another:\n\n# Select passenger columns and fare then arrange by fare\n\nglimpse(arrange(.data = select(.data = titanic_data,\n                                ends_with(\"passenger\"),\n                                fare),\n                desc(fare)))\n\nNotice that the input to arrange was the result of a select operation, so we had to keep track of our brackets and ensure that the desc(fare) was placed within arrange(), not select().\nGoing forward, we will see more verbs that can be applied on top of this, and it becomes difficult to manage.\nThis is where the pipe operator comes in.\n\n\n4.4.3 Introducing the Pipe\nThe Pipe Operator makes it possible to chain a sequence of functions starting with the base data as an input to the sequence.\nThis removes the need to type the .data argument each time.\n\nPrior to R 4.1, the pipe operator came from a package known as magrittr, which would be loaded alongside the tidyverse, and it took the form %>%.\nFrom R 4.1 onwards, the operator comes as standard with base R, as it has become the universal standard for data analysis. It now takes the form |>, and this option must be turned on in the Tools –> Global Options tab.\n\n\nThe shortcut for this operator is CTRL + SHIFT + M and is one you will use alot from here on.\n\n\nExample - Single Value\nLet’s return to our square root and rounding functions. Let’s apply one, and then both in sequence using our new operator.\n\nFirst, we write the value or dataset we wish to apply functions to, it is at the entrance to the “pipe” if you will.\nThen, we write the function we wish to use and any additional parameters we may need.\nThe pipe operator passes the input to the function, so we do not need to write it within the brackets.\n\n\n# Our first pipe - with a single value\n\n2 |> sqrt()\n\nYou can read the pipe operator as AND THEN.\nIt takes the output of one function AND THEN uses that as the input of the next function, and so on.\nThis means that to chain a sequence of functions, we will use the pipe operator again to pipe our output to our next function as its input.\n\n# Our first sequence of pipes\n\n2 |> sqrt() |> \n     round(digits = 2)\n\nThis is quite the shift from what we have done so far, but is more readable in plain english:\n\nTo the value 2, apply the square root function, and then, round that output to 2 decimal places.\n\nNotice, that following the second pipe, we insert a new line, which automatically moves us in a few spaces. This is optional but is easier to read as a sequence.\n\n\n4.4.4 Using the Pipe Operator with the tidyverse\nWhat was done above was an oversimplification of why the pipe was created, in reality it was created to pipe datasets into functions, as opposed to a single value.\nEven in the case of datasets, we do not need to pipe if we are only applying a single function such as glimpse().\nIt is when we are performing a chain of steps that the pipe completely simplifies our code, enhacing readability.\n\n\nExample\nLet’s return to our previous example, where we selected passenger demographics and sorted by fare.\n\nFirst, we write the dataset we want to apply this sequence of steps to.\nAND THEN pipe that into the select() function, specifying what columns we wish to retain.\nAND THEN pipe that output to the arrange() function, so that it can be sorted by whatever column(s) we wish.\n\n\n# Repeat earlier operation with pipes\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    select(ends_with(\"passenger\"),\n           fare) |> \n    arrange(desc(fare))\n\nThis way, the code is written in the order that it executes, as opposed to the reverse order without the pipe operator.\n\nTo the titanic dataset, we select columns that end with “passenger” as well as the fare column, and then, sort that in descending order of fare paid.\n\nWe could also pipe the output to a glimpse() for easier sense checking.\n\n# Pipeline with glimpse\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    select(ends_with(\"passenger\"),\n           fare) |> \n    arrange(desc(fare)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\n\nVariables with tidyverse chains\nNotice that we didn’t create a variable in the prior conversion.\nThis is because it can cause confusion between the assignment operator <- and the pipe operator |> if not covered separately.\nIn front of the previous sequence, known as a pipeline, we would write our variable name and assignment operator, which saves the final output in memory.\n\n# Save pipeline as a variable \n\ntitanic_demographics_sort <- titanic_data |> \n    select(ends_with(\"passenger\"),\n           fare) |> \n    arrange(desc(fare))\n\n\ntitanic_demographics_sort |> \n    glimpse()\n\nBe careful not to confuse the meaning of the two operators, this will take some practice to get used to.\n\n\n4.4.5 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\nSpeaking of pratice, let’s try out our new tool!\nCreate a pipeline that:\n\nSelects the first five columns of the data\nArranges them in ascending order of age.\n\nAssign this output to a new variable and glimpse it.\n\n\n\n# Selecting and ordering by age with pipes\n\ntitanic_age_sort <- titanic_data |> \n    select(pclass:age_of_passenger) |> \n    arrange(age_of_passenger)\n\ntitanic_age_sort |> \n    glimpse()"

    "text": "4.5 Filter\nOften, we are only interested in groups of rows that adhere to a specific condition, such as:\n\nPassengers that paid over or under a certain fare.\nPassengers who are in a particular age threshold.\nPassengers who embarked from a particular port.\n\nand of course, combinations of the above.\nThe next verb, filter() allows us to subset our rows in this way. To understand this section, we first need to consider conditions.\n\n4.5.1 Conditional Statements\nA conditional statement is one that returns TRUE or FALSE dependent on the outcome.\nWe saw examples of these back in Chapter 1, when we were producing logicals with comparisons. For example:\n\n4 < 5 is a condition statement that evaluates to TRUE\n4 != 4 is a conditional statement that evaluates to FALSE\n\n\n\n\nLogical Operator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n<\nLess Than\n\n\n<=\nLess Than or Equal To\n\n\n>\nGreater Than\n\n\n>=\nGreater Than or Equal To\n\n\n==\nEqual To\n\n\n!=\nNot Equal To\n\n\n|\nOr\n\n\n&\nAnd\n\n\n!\nNot\n\n\nany()\nChecks if any value in a logical vector are TRUE\n\n\nall()\nChecks if all values in a logical vector are TRUE\n\n\nis.na()\nIs the value missing (NA)?\n\n\nbetween()\nIs between 2 numbers\n\n\n\n\nNote: The “!” allows us to flip or invert an expression. Basically, if an expression returns c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE), the inverted expression (place ! in front of it) will return c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE).\n\nThese statements can of course be much more complex than comparing two single numbers, we can apply them across columns with dplyr’s filter() verb!\n\n\n4.5.2 Single Conditional Filtering\nWe will first look at filtering by a single condition, which are constructed as follows:\n\nWe begin with the column to compare with.\nNext is the logical operator of choice, such as <, >.\nLast up is the value to compare each entry in the column to, which generates the set of TRUEs and FALSEs.\n\nThis is generated in the background, and filter() will keep only the rows that return TRUE from this comparison.\n\nFor example, to subset down to only second class passengers, we would write: “pclass == 2”.\n\n\n\nExample - Categorical\n\n# Filter to retain only second class passengers\n\nsecond_class <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(pclass == 2) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nA quick way to check that the filter has worked is to use base R’s unique() function on the column.\nWe need to use our $ here to reference columns by name as this is not a tidyverse method.\nLet’s check the original data first.\n\n# Return unique values from the original data\n\nunique(titanic_data$pclass)\n\nWe see that the pclass column has 3 unique levels of 1, 2 and 3.\n\n# Return unique values from the filtered data\n\nunique(second_class$pclass)\n\nWe see that in the filtered data, we have just second class passengers, as expected.\n\n\nExample - Numeric\nLet’s filter to passengers who paid above £200.\n\n# Select passengers who paid more than 200\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(fare > 200) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nNotice that we didn’t save this as a variable, as this was just an example, one we will not carry forward in our analysis.\nHowever, if you are being asked to answer specific questions, then saving the outputs of your manipulation pipelines as variables is very useful, to prevent overwriting the base data.\n\n\n4.5.3 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\n\nUse filter to return the row for the passenger named: ‘Birkeland, Mr. Hans Martin Monsen’\nFilter for passengers that are male and save it as a variable. Can you count how many there were?\nFilter for passengers that are under 18 years of age and save it as a variable. Can you count how many there were?\nExtension - Harder: What percentage of passengers in the dataset survived? Remember, to compute a percentage, we must multiply the proportion by 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filtering to a specific passenger\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(name_of_passenger == \n               'Birkeland, Mr. Hans Martin Monsen') |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\nTo display the number of males in the filtered data, we simply need the number of rows, the length of the data!\n\n\n# Males only\n\ntitanic_male <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(sex_of_passenger == 'male')\n\n# Counting the number of males\n\nnrow(titanic_male)\n\n\nTo display the number of passengers below 18 years of age in the filtered data, we simply need the number of rows, the length of the data!\n\n\n# Underage passengers \n\ntitanic_underage <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(age_of_passenger < 18)\n\n\n# Counting the number of underage passengers\n\nnrow(titanic_underage)\n\n\nFirstly, we need to filter the dataset to those who survived, and the percentage would be calculated as:\n\n\nNumber of those who survived/Number of passengers as a whole * 100\n\nRemember, we can compute the number who survived and the number of passengers, we just need the number of rows in each subsequent tibble.\n\n# Passengers who survived\n\ntitanic_survived <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(survived == 1)\n\n# Survival percentage\n\n(nrow(titanic_survived) / nrow(titanic_data)) * 100\n\nSo we see that, tragically, only 38% of the passengers aboard the titanic survived.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Multiple Conditional Filtering\nWe have thus far filtered on conditions for a single column, but there is no reason we can’t use multiple conditions to filter by several conditions and/or columns at once.\nFor example:\n\nWe want male passengers who survived.\nWe want over 18 passengers who embarked from Southampton.\n\nHowever, we do need to think about how the conditions relate to each other.\n\n\nRelationships between conditions\nThere are two ways we can combine conditions together:\n\nAND relationships are given by the & symbol.\n\nThis implies both/all conditions must be met for a row to evaluate to TRUE before the filter is applied.\n\nOR relationships are given by the | symbol.\n\nThis implies that if any of the conditions can be met (one or more) a given row evaluates to TRUE before the filter is applied.\n\n\n\nThis does mean that combinations of TRUE and FALSE conditions can lead to different outputs with AND/OR relationships. This is summarised in the table below.\n\n\n\n\nCondition 1\nCondition 2\nAND Equates to\nOR Equates to\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5.5 Examples\nFor our first example, let’s filter to first class, female passengers.\nThis is an AND relationship, as they must be first class and female. Thus, any row that does not satisfy both of these conditions will be filtered out in the process.\nRemember that AND combinations are very strict, so ensure that the loss of a possibly large amount of data is appropriate for your analysis.\n\n# Filter to first class female passengers\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(pclass == 1 & sex_of_passenger == \"female\") |> \n    glimpse()\n\nFor our next example, let’s select passengers who were male OR adults (over 18).\nThis means that males under 18 will be kept and adult females will also be kept, as only one of the conditions needs to be true to be retained by filter!\n\n# Filter to males or adults\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(sex_of_passenger == \"male\" | age_of_passenger > 18) |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\n\n4.5.6 Special Cases of AND/OR\nWhilst the above conventions are easy to read from left to right, when constructing much more complex chains of conditions, it becomes laborious quickly.\nTo alleviate this, dplyr has some special functions that allow us to streamline cases of numerous conditions on the same column.\n\n\nThe between() function\nFirst is the between() function, which is similarly to an and relationship for conditions on numeric columns.\nIt allows us to specify:\n\nAn upper bound for the value in the column, a.k.a the value for which it should not be larger than or equal to.\nA lower bound for the value in the column, a.k.a the value for which it should not be smaller than or equal to.\n\n\nFor example, between(3.5 and 7.5) will retain values greater than or equal to 3.5 and less than or equal to 7.5.\n\nLet’s filter to those that paid between £250 and £500 for their tickets.\n\n# Filter to those that paid between two values\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(between(fare, left = 250, right = 500)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nWhich is equivalent to saying:\n\nfilter(fare >= 250 & fare <= 500)\n\nOf course, we can combine this with other conditions across columns as well.\n\n# Filter tho those that paid between ?250 and ?500 who were female\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(between(fare, left = 250, right = 500) & \n                   sex_of_passenger == \"female\") |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\n\nThe %in% function\nSecondly is the %in% function, which checks for membership of the column value in a vector of options we provide.\nThis is similar to an OR relationship, as it allows us to bring through multiple values from a column.\nLet’s filter to capture those that embarked from Southampton or Cherbourg.\n\n# Filter to those that embarked from S or C\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(embarked %in% c(\"S\", \"C\")) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nWe can check with distinct() whether this accomplished what we were looking for.\n\n# Filter to those that embarked from S or C and check\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(embarked %in% c(\"S\", \"C\")) |> \n    distinct(embarked)\n\nThis process would be equivalent to performing:\n\nfilter(embarked == “S” | embarked == “C”)\n\nand is incredibly useful for larger categorical variables we wish to trim.\nAs with between(), we can also combine this with other conditions.\n\n# Select passengers embarking from S or C that were male\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(embarked  %in% c(\"S\", \"C\") &\n           sex_of_passenger == \"male\") |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\n\n4.5.7 Negating Conditions\nWe can also use the negation operator ! to reverse the outcome of the condition.\nThis is useful for cases where exclusion is quicker than typing out conditions for inclusion.\nSay for example you have a categorical variable with 9 unique categories.\nYou are interested in filtering so that only 8 of the categories remain. Instead of chaining OR conditions together, you can instead write the condition that would return just that one, and negate it to remove it instead.\n\n\nExample\nLet’s see this in action by negating the statement to select passengers who embarked from Southampton,\nThis is the opposite of writing out filters to retain Cherbourg and Queenstown. This is a great time saving measure for larger datasets.\n\n# Use negation to filter down to passengers embarking from Cherbourg or Queenstown\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(!embarked == \"S\") |> \n    distinct(embarked)\n\nThis is, of course equivalent to using the not equal != comparison in such a simple case:\n\n# Filter for passengers who did not embark from Southampton\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(embarked != \"S\") |> \n    distinct(embarked)\n\n\n\nExample - AND/OR Negation\nOf course, if you negate and and/or relationships:\n\nNot only is each individual condition negated\nThe and/or is reversed to or/and respectively\n\nThis comes from logical statements in mathematics, specifically, De Morgan’s laws.\n\nLet’s take an example we we required those that embarked from Southampton or paid above £100 in fare.\nMathematically speaking, if we negate this condition, we get:\n\n!(southampton OR > 100 fare) = (!southampton AND !>100 fare)\n\nIt is recommended to wrap your OR/AND condition in brackets, to ensure the negation is carried throughout.\n\n# Harder example\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(!(embarked == \"S\" | fare > 100)) |> \n    distinct(embarked)\n\nWe see that we have indeed negated the selection of Southampton, as expected.\n\n\n4.5.8 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\n\nFilter so that only second or third class passengers are included in the data.\nFilter so that only passengers who travelled alone are included in the data. How many were there?\nExtension Exercise - What percentage of passengers who embarked from Cherbourg or Queenstown and paid a fare between £100 and £350 survived?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Filter for second or third class passengers\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    filter(pclass  %in% c(2, 3)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\n\nFor those travelling alone, their sibsp and parch values should be 0.\n\n\n# Filtering for passengers travelling alone\n\nlone_passengers <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(sibsp == 0 & parch == 0) |> \n    glimpse()\n\n# How many there are\n\nnrow(lone_passengers)\n\n\nThis is a multi-stage problem, so we must filter for the required conditions (saving it to a variable), then compute the percentage.\n\nSince we need all of these conditions to be TRUE, we must use & to combine them.\n\n# Filter for those that embarked from C or Q, paid certain fare and survived\n\ncherb_queens_survivors <- titanic_data |> \n    filter(embarked %in% c(\"C\", \"Q\") &\n           between(fare, left = 100, right = 350) &\n           survived == 1)\n\n# Compute final percentage\n\nround((nrow(cherb_queens_survivors) / nrow(titanic_data)) * 100, digits = 2)"

    "text": "4.6 Mutate\nWhen cleaning and transforming data, we often want to apply changes at the column level, such as:\n\nConverting to lower case/any character work\nRounding to a specified number of dp\nConverting the datatype\nCombine columns into ratios/proportions - known as calculated columns \n\nTo accomplish all of the above, we need our next verb, mutate(). To create a new column, we use the following syntax:\n\nmutate(new_column_name = contents_of_column)\n\n\n4.6.1 Constant Value Variables\nThe simplest example would be adding a constant column, which contains the same value all the way down.\nWhilst the applications of this are minimal, it is the best first example for understanding mutate.\n\n# Add a constant character column\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    mutate(character_col = \"two\") |> # Column filled with the string \"two\"\n    glimpse() \n\nAs another example, let’s add a numeric constant column.\n\n# Add a constant numeric column\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    mutate(numeric_col = 3.14) |> # Column of pi\n    glimpse()\n\n\n\n4.6.2 Modifying existing variables\nThe mutate function is incredibly smart, as it allows us to apply functions to an entire column, with each cell transformed in turn.\nFor example, should we wish to make the name of passenger column lower case, we can use the str_to_lower() function from stringr.\nTo apply a function to an existing column:\n\nmutate(existing_column = function(existing_column,..))\n\n\n# Convert names column to lower case\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    mutate(name_of_passenger = str_to_lower(name_of_passenger)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nAnother example might be to round the age column to the nearest whole number, which could allow for conversion to an integer.\n\n# Round the age column to the nearest whole number\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    mutate(age_of_passenger = round(age_of_passenger)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nThis has the unexpected consequence of rounding the passenger with an age of 0.1667 (around 2 months) to 0, which makes no sense given the context. As such, it may be better to round to 2 decimal places.\nLet’s do the same thing to the fare column as well, since money in GBP (£) is presented as two decimal places.\n\n# Round the fare column to 2 decimal places\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    mutate(fare = round(fare, digits = 2)) |> \n    glimpse()\n\nNotice that we have forgotten something, as age still has 4 decimal places.\n\n\nExercise\n\nExerciseSolution\n\n\nIdentify the mistake we have made when converting existing columns and fix this mistake so that we permanently update them.\n\n\nWe did not overwrite and reassign the titanic_data variable, we just observed the changes without permanently making them.\n\n# Round the fare and age columns to 2 decimal places\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(age_of_passenger = round(age_of_passenger, digits = 2),\n           fare = round(fare, digits = 2))\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)\n\n\n\n\nOf course, this does not mean we should be overwriting titanic_data everytime, as often we are just overviewing a transformation and sense checking it.\n\n\n4.6.3 Calculated Columns\nLet’s see an example of creating a bespoke column by combining existing ones.\nHere we will create the family size of each person. To compute this we need:\n\nThe number of siblings or spouses on board (sibsp)\nThe numbr of parents or children on board (parch)\nThe person themselves, as they aren’t factored in to sibsp or parch\n\n\n# Determining family size per passenger\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(family_size = sibsp + parch + 1) # Add 1 for the person themselves\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)\n\n\n\n4.6.4 Conditional Columns\nWe can also use conditions like when we filtered, to create a logical column of TRUEs and FALSEs.\nThese are very common and are often known as binary flags, as they denote whether a certain condition is attained or not.\nThis is structured as follows:\n\nmutate(new_col = (condition)) where the condition is “column operator value”, such as “fare < 200”.\n\n\n# Creating a conditional column on whether passenger is female\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(is_female = (sex_of_passenger == \"female\"))\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)\n\nUsually we want binary flags in numeric form, as most models we supply our data to require numeric variables.\nThis means we need to convert TRUE and FALSE to their numeric representations of 0 and 1.\nWe can use complex functions for matching and converting to perform this step. In particular, the case_match() function, which takes the following form:\n\ncase_match(column, value_to_change ~ new_value, value_to_change ~ new_value)\n\n\n# Recode is_female to numeric\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(is_female = case_match(is_female,\n                                  TRUE ~ 1, # Convert instances of TRUE to 1\n                                  FALSE ~ 0)) # Convert instances of FALSE to 0\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)\n\nYou may not have seen this notation before with the tilde ~, this is known as a formula in R, where the right hand side is equivalent to the left hand side.\nThis is common convention in R, seen most with linear modelling to define the equation. See this technical article on the tilde for more information.\n\n\n4.6.5 Exercise\n\nExerciseShow Answer\n\n\nCreate a new column called “fare_dollars”, which converts the fare from GBP (£) to USD ($). The current exchange rate as of January 2024 is:\n\n£1 = $1.27\n\nEnsure that the column is rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n\n\n# Create fare dollars and rounding the output\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(fare_dollars = round(fare * 1.39, digits = 2))\n\nglimpse(titanic_data)"

    "section": "4.7 Joining Data",
    "text": "4.7 Joining Data\nMuch of the information we need to answer questions of interest is featured across multiple smaller datasets, so we can join or merge them together for one cohesive dataset.\nWe do require something essential for this to be possible, however, a column in common such as a unique identifier or reference, such as:\n\nNHS number, allowing for data linkage across the NHS.\nAny account number allows for data linkage aross financial institutions.\nEmail, phone numbers, social media hangles allow for data linkage across social media and online shopping.\nAddresses allow for spatial data linkage, for geospatial applications\n\n\nNaming Conventions for Join\nThe dplyr package has a family of functions for joins.\nThey take the form type_join where the prefix “type” denotes the type of join itself.\nA naming convention we must establish here is that of the tibbles themselves, namely:\n\nThe larger dataset, the one we just to join data to, is the left tibble.\nThe smaller dataset, the one we want to join to another, is the right tibble.\n\n\n\n4.7.1 Types of Join\n\ninner_join - A stricter join where only data common to both tibbles is retained.\nfull_join - All data from both tibbles is retained, matched up where possible.\nleft_join - All data from the left tibble is retained, and only matching rows are merged from the right tibble.\nright_join - All data from the right tibble is retained, and only matching rows are merged from the left tibble. This is the inverse process of the left join.\n\nGraphically:\n\nThere are also Semi Joins and Anti Joins for filtering, which you can read about in Hadley Wickhams R for Data Science Chapter 19\n\n\n4.7.2 Examples\nJoins are best explored using examples of each type.\nWe will use 2 very small datasets that come with dplyr to build this up.\nThe first is band_members, which we must assign to a variable to save in the global environment.\n\nmembers_data <- band_members\n\nmembers_data\n\nThe second is band instruments, which seems to have some connection to the prior dataset.\n\ninstruments_data <- band_instruments\n\ninstruments_data\n\nThese data sets have one common column which is name, so we can join them to have both band and plays in the same dataset.\nLet’s assume that members_data is the left dataset and instruments_data is the right.\nPre-empting what will happen based on the above venn diagrams:\n\nJohn and Paul appear in both datasets, so will be retained for most common joins.\nMick only appears in the members_data, so may disappear with stricter joins.\nKeith only appears in the instruments_data, so may disappear with stricter joins.\n\n\n\nJoin Syntax\nThe join functions take numerous arguments, with the following being required:\n\nx - the left tibble\ny - the right tibble\nby - the column to join on\n\nand take the form:\n\ntype_join(x = left_tibble, y = right_tibble, by = join_col) where we can pipe in the left_tibble.\n\n\n\nInner Join\nStarting with the inner join, this will only retain rows common to both datasets, which would see Mick and Keith removed.\n\n# Perform an inner join on band members and instruments data.\n\nmembers_data |> \n    inner_join(y = instruments_data,\n               by = \"name\")\n\nAs expected, we kept John and Paul, and now have another column of information about them!\n\n\nFull Join\nA full join retains all rows across both datasets, but this raises the question of what happens to the entry in the column that they aren’t featured? i.e.\n\nMick has no plays entry\nKeith has no band entry\n\nSimply, they are filled with NA, as they are missing.\n\n# Perform a full join on instruments and band data\n\nmembers_data |> \n    full_join(y = instruments_data,\n              by = \"name\")\n\nWe see that, indeed, Mick has no entry for plays and Keith has no entry in band.\n\n\nLeft Join\nA left join retains all rows in the left tibble, and just the matching data in the right. This means Mick will come along with an NA in the plays column, but Keith will be lost entirely.\n\n# Perform left join on band and instruments data\n\nmembers_data |> \n    left_join(y = instruments_data,\n              by = \"name\")\n\n\n\nRight Join\nA right join is the opposite of a left join, so we will retain all values in the right tibble, including Keith, but only matching data in the left tibble, which means we will lose Mick.\n\n# Right join on band and instruments data\n\nmembers_data |> \n    right_join(y = instruments_data,\n               by = \"name\")\n\n\n\n4.7.3 Matching columns with different names\nA very common problem that occurs when joining is matching columns being named differently.\nThis can sometimes be easily rectified with a rename(), but there will be cases where modifying the data in this way is not allowed.\nThis is where the join_by() function from dplyr comes in, providing us a way to specify that two differently named columns are indeed the same.\n\n\nExample\nHere we introduce the band_instruments2 data, which is similar to the former but with one key difference.\n\n# Instruments data\n\ninstruments2_data <- band_instruments2\n\ninstruments2_data\n\nThe name variable is called “artist” here.\nWithin join_by(), we must set the column names of note equal to each other, using:\n\njoin_by(left_col_name == right_col_name)\n\nLet’s join together band_instruments2 with the members data, using the join_by() function.\n\n# Join columns with names that don't match\n\nmembers_data |> \n    full_join(y = band_instruments2,\n              by = join_by(name == artist))\n\n\n\n4.7.4 Binding Datasets\nAnother common way in which datasets are combined is by binding them, where one dataset is appended on top of the other either row by row or column by column.\nWith row binding:\n\nColumns are matched by name automatically, so the positioning of them does not matter.\nMissing columns will be filled with NA, so we must be careful of this.\n\nWith column binding:\n\nRows are matched by position, so the tibbles we bind absolutely must have the same number of rows, otherwise we will get an error.\n\n\n\nBinding Rows\nWe use the bind_rows() function from dplyr, which will widen the dataset by adding more entries.\n\n# Row bind the instruments tibbles\n\ninstruments_data |> \n    bind_rows(instruments2_data)\n\nSince instruments2 has the name variable and instruments has the artist variable, these are seen as independent, and hence filled with NAs since they don’t match.\n\n\nBinding Columns\nWe use the bind_cols() function from dplyr, which will lengthen the dataset by adding more variables.\n\n# Column bind instruments 1 and 2\n\ninstruments_data |> \n    bind_cols(instruments2_data)\n\nNotice that despite plays being a repeating column, it is binded as we asked, and differentiated by its position, with the second column being “plays…2” and the fourth being “plays…4”.\n\n\nWhy we bind\nWhen data is collected consistently, it is often in the same form, be that monthly, weekly, annually and so on.\nTo create a historic time series, data must be sequentially appended unless separate storage is required.\nThis is often part of an automated process where data is ingested and then appended onto the existing, larger, collected dataset.\n\n\n4.7.5 Union()\nAnother very useful function is union() which will stack the data vertically, but keep only the distinct (unique) rows.\nThis means that any duplicated rows that exist in the current tibble are not brought over in the process.\nHowever, this does NOT remove duplicated values, only entire duplicated rows in the combined data, an important distinction to make.\n\n# Band members and instruments\n\ninstruments_data |> \n    union(instruments2_data)\n\nYou will see that this causes an error, because Union is very strict about it’s combination, in that all columns must match.\nLet’s create a small tibble with matching columns to test this out.\n\n# Create new entries for instruments data\n\nartist <- c(\"Mick\", \"Bono\", \"Ringo\", \"John\")\n\nplays <- c(\"guitar\", \"guitar\", \"piano\", \"guitar\")\n\ninstruments3_data <- tibble(artist = artist, plays = plays)\n\ninstruments3_data\n\nNow let’s union this instruments2, who’s columns match exactly:\n\n# Union the instruments datasets\n\ninstruments2_data |> \n    union(instruments3_data)\n\nNotice that John, who would have been duplicated in the combination, was removed as intended by union()."

    "text": "3.1 Numerical Data\nThe summarise() verb allows us to create one or more numeric variables summarising the variables we specify.\nThere are many summary statistics functions we can use with summarise():\n\nmean() - The average (arithmetic mean) data value in the given column.\nmedian() - The middle value of an ordered vector of values.\n\nIf the vector has an odd number of values, it is the exact middle value.\nIf the vector has an even number of values, there is no middle, so the median is the average of the numbers either side (e.g. if there are 80 values, the median is the average of the 39th and 40th value).\n\nvar() - The variance measures the degree of spread of each point from the mean. It is the square of the standard deviation.\nsd() - The standard deviation (spread) of values in from the mean. It is the square root of the variance.\nquantile() - Produces sample quantiles corresponding to the given proportions (between 0 and 1). We can compute upper and lower quartiles with this.\nmin() - The smallest value in the given column.\nmax() - The maximum value in the given column.\nn() - Counts the number of entries (rows).\nn_distinct() - Counts the number of unique entries for a given variable.\n\n\nExamples\nLet’s compute the mean fare paid by passengers on the titanic.\nThe summarise() verb takes the following form:\n\nsummarise(agg_col_name = summary_function(col)) notice that we can name the column as well!\n\n\n# Calculating the mean fare paid \n\ntitanic_data |> \n    summarise(mean(fare)) # Compute mean of fare column\n\n\nThis highlights something very important, that any operation applied to a column containing one or more missing values, produces an average of NA.\n\nThis is because we are adding something that is Not a Number (it does not exist) to an actual number, which is not defined (think dividing by 0 or adding infinity).\nBy default, this will throw most of the summary functions, but there is an optional parameter we can turn on, called “na.rm = TRUE”.\nThis will omit any NA values in our calculation and produce a more meaningful result, albeit on a subset of observed data.\n\n# Calculating the mean fare paid by passengers, removing NAs\n\ntitanic_data |>  \n    summarise(mean(fare, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nTo assign this a meaningful column name, we’d pass a keyword argument before the summary function used:\n\nagg_col_name = summary_function(column, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n# Calculating the mean fare paid and naming it\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    summarise(mean_fare = mean(fare, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nIf we didn’t care about the tibble output summarise generates, we could simply compute using base R syntax:\n\n# Calculating the mean fare with base R\n\nmean(titanic_data$fare, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nLike we saw with mutate() and other functions, we can compute multiple statistics through summarise(), separating with commas.\n\n# Calculating multiple summary statistics with summarise()\n\ntitanic_data |>  \n    summarise(median_fare = median(fare, na.rm = TRUE),\n              mean_fare = mean(fare, na.rm = TRUE),\n              sd_fare = sd(fare, na.rm = TRUE),\n              median_age = median(age_of_passenger, na.rm = TRUE),    \n              mean_age = mean(age_of_passenger, na.rm = TRUE),        \n              sd_age = sd(age_of_passenger, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Quantiles\nWe can also calculate quantiles, such as the upper and lower quartile within summarise().\nTo do this, we must specify a value between 0 and 1, which denotes the nth percentile/quantile. For example:\n\n0.1 denotes the 10th percentile - All values in order up to the value at the 10% spot.\n0.25 denotes the lower quartile - All values in order up to the value at the 25% spot.\n0.75 denotes the upper quartile - All values in order up to the value at the 75% spot.\n\n\n\nExamples\nThe quantile function is structured as:\n\nquantile(col, probs = c(0,1),..) where probs should be the value of the quantile you want.\n\n\n# Computing the lower quartile\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    summarise(fare_lower = quantile(fare, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n# Computing the upper quartile\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    summarise(fare_upper = quantile(fare, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "section": "4.3 The impact of NAs",
    "text": "4.3 The impact of NAs\nIdeally, we don’t want the null values being a category of their own and cluttering up our summary tables.\nWhen investigating data, we either:\n\nDeal with these at read in.\nMeticulously clean them with imputation methods (fill them in).\nDrop them entirely (be very careful with this!).\n\ntidyr comes to the rescue when we are dealing with NAs as it has some handy functions to work with them:\n\ndrop_na() removes all rows with missing values present.\nreplace_na() fills in the missing values with whatever we specify.\n\nLet’s see a few small examples of this in practice.\n\n4.3.1 Filling missing values\nWe should always attempt to understand why values are missing before dealing with them.\nDomain expertise comes into play when deciding whether it makes sense for a value to be missing, think of temperature:\n\nA missing temperature reading is not the same as a temperature reading of 0 degrees celsius.\n\nAs such, it wouldn’t make sense to fill the NAs with 0, as we create bias by over inflating the number of 0 temperature values.\nA better approach in cases such as this is to fill with an average, preferably one not impacted by outliers, such as the median.\n\n\nExample\nLet’s consider first which numeric variables have missing values. We can check this by using the is.na() function.\nThis returns a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs, one for each cell in the table, for whether they are missing or not.\nWe can then sum() these up to find the total number of missing values in that column.\n\n# Compute number of missing values in age_of_passenger\n\ntitanic_data$age_of_passenger |> \n    is.na() |> \n    sum()\n\nRepeating this for each column becomes laborious quickly, so there are some options for us:\n\nUse colSums() to sum the outputs of a function across columns.\nCreate a User defined function or Anonymous Function to apply across the columns of the dataset using functional programming in purrr.\n\nWhilst the latter is recommended, it is beyond the scope of this current chapter, and features in later more advanced courses.\nLet’s try colSums():\n\n# Use colSums() to find the missing values\n\ntitanic_data |> is.na() |> \n    colSums()\n\nNow that we have understood the number of missing values, let’s see some imputation.\n\n\nFilling a numeric column with an average\nWe know that age_of_passenger has 267 missing values, but filling these in with 0 makes no sense and will skew the data.\nA better approach would be to impute with an average, that way we maximise our attempt to keep the data centralised.\nHowever, we must also be careful which statistic we use, as some are more robust than others:\n\nThe mean is heavily influenced by outliers (as it includes them in the calculation).\nThe median is a more robust measure as it does not consider the end points of the data (not influenced by outliers).\n\n\nExample\nThe replace_na() functions takes a few arguments:\n\nThe data itself\nreplace - What to fill the NAs with\n\nUsing this effectively requires us to also use mutate() as this modifies an existing column, as opposed to us using base R functionality to refer to columns with $.\nLet’s use is.na() and colSums() to check it worked:\n\n# Impute missing age values with median \n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> # overwrite to save changes\n    mutate(age_of_passenger = replace_na(age_of_passenger,\n                                         replace = median(age_of_passenger,\n                                                          na.rm = TRUE)))\n\nLet’s check this worked:\n\n# Check imputation\n\ntitanic_data |> is.na() |> \n    colSums()\n\n\n\n\nFilling a categorical column with an average\nWith categorical columns, the most robust method we can use to impute is using the most frequently occuring value, or the mode.\nThere is no built in function for this in base R, requiring an outside package in order to so. However, we can observe the mode with the output from count().\n\nExample\nWe saw that embarked had 2 missing values, let’s fill them with the mode.\n\n# Find the mode of the embarked column\n\ntitanic_data |> \n    count(embarked)\n\nWe see that “S” or “Southhampton” was the most commonly departed from port among passengers.\nLet’s fill this in with replace_na():\n\n# Fill embarked in with the mode\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    mutate(embarked = replace_na(embarked, replace = \"S\")) \n\nLet’s check again:\n\n# Check that embarked impute worked\n\ntitanic_data |> is.na() |> \n    colSums()\n\nImputation is a very deep topic and goes beyond the scope of the course, but we recommend researching this for other examples.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Dropping Missing Values\nWe must be very careful about doing this, as we previously noted that there may be a pattern to how or why they are missing, and as such can be treated.\nWe risk lowering variance across our dataset by removing them, but if analysis determines that there is no easy way to impute them, dropping them might be the only option.\n\n\nExample\nWe use the drop_na() function to drop null values remaining.\n\nIn our example, cabin is roughly 75% missing, and with a variety of categories of all different forms, imputation would be a nightmare.\n\nAs such, we would elect to exclude this column with select().\n\nSimilarly, there is only one missing fare value, which it is more efficient to drop than fill with an average.\n\n\n# Drop the null values in fare\n\ntitanic_data <- titanic_data |> \n    select(-cabin) |> \n    drop_na(fare)"

    "section": "3.1 For Loops",
    "text": "3.1 For Loops\nThese are the most common type of loop the other type is a while loop which can do the same things, but in a slightly different way.\nFor loops follow the basic structure below.\n\n# Basic Structure of a loop\n\n# Creating the loop\nfor (each_item in my_iterable) { \n  \n     output <- commands\n  }\n\n\nWe start the loop with the word for,\nFollowed by () brackets where we first specify an index variable, i is commonly used but it can be anything that you want. Remember, we want to use clear and descriptive variable names. This is a place holder and corresponds to each different element as we move through the loop,\nThen the word in.\nThen specify an iterable. This could be a vector, a list, a dataframe etc. An iterable is any object that can be iterated through, one element at a time.\nFollowed by the {} curly brackets, which will have our commands within, these could be multiple lines of code.\n\n\n3.1.1 Example\nLet’s look at an example.\nWe start by creating an iterable, I have created a vector with the numbers 0 through 5.\n\n# Creating a vector\n\nexample_vector <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nWe can then create our loop which doubles every value and prints it out.\n\n# Creating the loop\n\nfor (each_number in example_vector) {\n     \n     # Print the value at each step\n     print(each_number * 2)\n  \n  }\n\n[1] 0\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n[1] 10\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example we simply printed our results in the console, if we wanted to store our result, we can simply create a data structure of our choice and use the append function, as shown below.\nThe keyword for is followed by a variable that refers to each item in my iterable. I’ve called this variable each_number. It is good to be clear and explicit when naming variables, so they explain what the variable is.\nThe keyword in is followed by the iterable I want to loop over - example_vector.\nThe output of my command is appended to result. The command here is to multiply each number in example_vector by 2. The append() function simply adds an element to the end of a vector. We first specify the vector we want to add to which is result and then specify the values that we want to add to it. Within the function this is set to the parameter values.\n\n# Create an empty output\n# Which we will fill when the loop runs\n\nresult <- c()\n\n# Creating the loop\n\nfor (each_number in example_vector) {\n  \n     # Print the value at each step\n     print(each_number * 2)\n  \n     result <- append(result, values = each_number * 2)\n  \n}\n\n[1] 0\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n[1] 6\n[1] 8\n[1] 10\n\n# To display the data\n\nresult\n\n[1]  0  2  4  6  8 10\n\n\n\nAlthough it is useful to know how to use loops in R, it is often faster to accomplish the same thing using vectorised operations in R.\nWe already saw examples in the Vector Arithmetic section. A vectorised function is a function that will apply the same operation on each element of the vectors.\nFor example:\n\n# Creating a vector\n\nexample_vector <- 1:5\n\n# Using a sqrt() function on our vector\n\nsqrt(example_vector)\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\n\nTo make this calculation, there is no need for a loop. However, not all functions work this way.\nWhile there are many functions out there that vectorise particular calculations, there are still some tasks that cannot be vectorised. This is where iteration becomes useful. While we should always be looking to vectorise calculations, we can take comfort knowing that we have a back up tool to use just in case it fails us.\nWe also have while loops, which are used to loop until a specific condition is met.\nYou can a find a tutorial on them here: While Loop.\n\n\n3.1.2 Exercise 1\n\nExerciseHintAnswer\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector of measurements that are grams (g).\nFor this exercise, we want to convert all of these measurements to kilograms (kg).\nFor reference, 1kg is equal to 1000 grams.\nUsing a for loop, create and append to a new vector called kilograms that contains the values converted to kilograms.\n\n\n# Vector \n\ngrams <- c(100000, 7899900, 967312, 49185, 6100)\n\n\n\nPlease note below is pseudocode, that is the ‘recipie’ for getting the answer.\n\n# Starting vector\n\ngrams <- c(100000, 7899900, 967312, 49185, 6100)\n\n# Empty vector for result storage\n\nkilograms <- c()\n\n# For loop\n\nfor (each_number in vector) {\n  \n     convert to kilograms\n  \n     append result to kilograms\n}\n\n\n# To display the data\n\nkilograms\n\n\n\n\n# Starting vector\n\ngrams <- c(100000, 7899900, 967312, 49185, 6100)\n\n# Empty vector for result storage\n\nkilograms <- c()\n\n# For loop\n\nfor (measurement in grams) {\n    # Converting grams to kg\n    converted_kilogram <- measurement / 1000 \n  \n    # Appending to kilo_grams result vector\n    kilograms <- append(kilograms, values = converted_kilogram) \n  \n}\n\n# To display the data\n\nkilograms\n\n[1]  100.000 7899.900  967.312   49.185    6.100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Extension Exercise\nIf you would like to go deeper into for loops before moving on, try the extension exercise below.\n\nExerciseHintShow Answer\n\n\n\nComplete the code below, Use a for loop to load all the files in the data folder.

A while loop iterates until it no longer meets a certain condition.\n\n# Create an empty output\n# Which we will fill when the loop runs\n\nresult <- c()\n\n# Creating the loop\n\nwhile (logical_condition) { \n  \n  result <- commands\n  \n}\n\n# To display the data\n\nresult\n\n\nSo we start with creating an empty vector for our output\nThen the word while\nfollowed by the () brackets in which we specify our logical condition, using the conditional operators.\nand then {}, which surrounds our commands. These commands will be run repeatedly in order as long as the specified condition is TRUE.\n\n\n3.2.1 Example\nLet’s look at an example:\n\nLet us first set the stop_value to 0.\nand we set our condition to be stop_value < 5\nthen print out the value of stop_value\nand then add one to the value.\n\n\n# Create an empty output\n# Which we will fill when the loop runs\n\nresult <- c()\n\n# Setting the value\n\nstop_value <- 0\n\n# Creating the loop\n# Our condition here is that stop_value < 5\n\nwhile (stop_value < 5) { \n  \n  print(stop_value)\n  \n  stop_value <- stop_value + 1 \n  \n  result <-  append(result, stop_value + 1)\n}\n\n[1] 0\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n\n# To display the data\n\nresult\n\n[1] 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nCan you guess what would happen if we removed the stop_value <- stop_value + 1 ?\n\n# Create an empty output\n# Which we will fill when the loop runs\n\nresult <- c()\n\n# Setting the value\n\nstop_value <- 0\n\n# Creating the loop\n# Our condition here is that 0<5 i.e stop_value\n\nwhile (stop_value < 5) { \n  \n  print(stop_value)\n  \n  result <- append(result, values = stop_value + 1)\n}\n\n# To display the data\n\nresult\n\nIf we removed the code stop_value <- stop_value +1 , stop_value (0) would always be less than 5 and the loop would be stuck in an infinite loop, as R will never stop running the code!\n\nYou will have to hit the stop sign to exit the loop!\n\nIt is therefore important that we design while loops that have a logical condition that will be met at some point.\nAlthough it is useful to know how to use loops in R, it is often faster to accomplish the same thing using vectorised operations in R.\nWe already saw examples in the Vector Arithmetic section. A vectorized function is a function that will apply the same operation on each of the vectors.\nFor example,\n\n# Creating a vector\n\nexample_vector <- 1:5\n\n# Using a sqrt() function on our vector\n\nsqrt(example_vector)\n\n[1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051 2.000000 2.236068\n\n\nTo make this calculation, there is no need for a loop. However, not all functions work this way."

    "text": "4.1 If, else if, else\nA conditional statement will check whether a statement is TRUE or FALSE.\nIf a criteria is met, we may want to run different code than if it is not met.\nThis is useful if we want a function or code block to run only when our data meets certain conditions; this is termed control flow.\nControl flow is something we do in everyday life.\nFor example when we go shopping and choose fruits, we normally want to buy the ones that look juicy and healthy and avoid the ones that look rotten or bruised.\nAs we pick up our fruit and inspect it, we are actually using control flow.\n\n\nIn order to move through this decision process, we need to answer either “Yes” or “No” to each question.\nA series of “Yes” answers will lead us to buy an orange that matches our set criteria.\nThis links in with the logical or Boolean data types that we covered in Chapter One, Getting Started With R, as our logical statement has to be either TRUE or FALSE.\nTo evaluate these we use comparison operators which we used in Chapter 4 Working With Dataframes where we used the filter() function.\nThese comparison and logical operators allow us to control the flow of our code.\nComparison Operators.\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n<\nless than\n\n\n>\ngreater than\n\n\n<=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n>=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n\nLogical Operators.\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n&\nAnd\n\n\n|\nOr\n\n\n!\nNot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition 1\nCondition 2\n& (AND) Equates to\n| (OR) Equates to\n\n\n\n\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\nOur example above shows that we can make a decision by answering “Yes” or “No” at two key points. But often this will not be the case - we might have only a single question, or we might want to add some more branches to our responses.\nR allows us to have complete control over our statement by using the if, else if, and else keywords.\nWe always first put an:\n\nif statement\n\nthen an optional number (0 to many) of:\n\nelse if statements\n\nthen finally an optional singular:\n\nelse statement\n\nif, else if and else are not loops, but fall under the category of control flow.\nThese take a conditional argument, and if that is met (evaluates to TRUE) then the associated action is completed.\nIf the condition is not met it will move to the next statement and try to evaluate it; if that condition is met the associated action will be completed.\nFinally, if none of the conditions are met, the else condition’s associated actions are run.\nWe separate out out different command blocks relating to each condition using curly brackets {} around the corresponding block of code.\n\nif (first_condition) { \n  \n    execute_this\n  \n} else if (second_condition) { \n  \n    execute_this\n  \n} else {\n  \n    execute_this\n  \n}\n\n\nIt’s important that the else if keyword comes on the same line as the closing bracket of the previous part of the control structure.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at an example.\nWe can just have an if and an else - else if statements are optional (as is the final else statement!)\n\nheight <- 5\n\nif (height == 5) { \n  \n    print(\"We're the same height\")\n  \n} else {\n  \n    print(\"Your height is different\")\n  \n}\n\n[1] \"We're the same height\"\n\n\nRemember our if, else if and else statements take a condition so we need a double equals sign == for checking equivalence.\nIf the first criteria isn’t met it will move to the else statement and action that.\nWe can add in more choices using an else if statement.\n\nheight <- 7\n\nif (height == 5) { \n  \n    print(\"Your height is 5\")\n  \n} else if (height == 7) { \n  \n    print(\"We are the same height\")\n \n} else {\n  \n   print(\"Your height is not 5 or 7\")\n  \n}\n\n[1] \"We are the same height\"\n\n\nWithin our condition we can use the logical operators too: & (and); | (or), in order to make more complex conditions.\nHere we want the action to happen if the value is greater than 7 and less than 10.\n\nheight <- 9\n\nif (height == 5) { \n  \n   print(\"Your height is 5\")\n  \n} else if (height > 7 & height < 10) { \n  \n   print(\"You're height is between 7 and 10\")\n  \n} else {\n  \n   print(\"Your height is different\")\n  \n}\n\n[1] \"You're height is between 7 and 10\"\n\n\nIt’s important to know how the if, else if, else works.\nBelow we have two options for when the value is 5. However it will only print out “We’re the same height!” as when a condition is met, the code associated with it is run, and R stops evaluating the rest of the conditionals.\nIn this code the block print(\"Wow, it's still 5!\") will never run. If the height is equal to 5, the first if condition will run, and then the logic stops.\nTry changing the value stored in height to see the other results.\n\nheight <- 5\n\nif (height == 5) { \n  \n   print(\"We're the same height\")\n  \n} else if (height > 7 & height < 10) { \n  \n   print(\"You're tall!\")\n  \n} else if (height == 5) {\n  \n   print(\"Wow, it's still 5!\")\n  \n} else {\n  \n   print(\"Your height is different\")\n  \n}\n\n[1] \"We're the same height\"\n\n\n\nA good practical example of if and else statements can be seen here PHE"

    "text": "5.1 Why we use functions\n\nThey make code shorter and easier to understand.\nThey make it easier to update code, as we only need to change one place.\nFunctions allow us to easily repeat similar tasks.\nThey help reduce errors caused from copying and pasting code multiple times.\n\nUp until now we’ve been writing code line by line and running it sequentially. As effective as this has been, things can get messy as we scale up to larger problems.\nWe can avoid messy code by organising it into chunks of reusable code called functions. This allows us to create blocks of code dedicated to performing a specific procedure or task. We can then ‘call’ this function to perform its specific task as and when needed. Understanding why and how to write functions is an important part of writing code that is consistent, readable and reproducible.\nIn addition to this, we use functions to do everything in R - from making a vector to creating models and plots. Having more hands on experience with functions can give you a greater appreciation for how the functions, we heavily depend on, are implemented.\nWe can take one complicated operation and wrap it up inside a function and use it wherever we need.\nFor example, take the mean() function from base R that calculates the average value of a given vector — we could write out the average calculation by hand:\n\n# Creating a vector\nnumbers <- 1:19\n\n# Calculating the mean \n# Here I am using the sum function and the length function\nmean_numbers <- sum(numbers) / length(numbers)\n\n# To Display the data\nmean_numbers\n\n[1] 10\n\n# Using the mean function\nmean(numbers)\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nNothing stops us from writing out sum(numbers) / length(numbers) every time we need to calculate an average.\nUsing the mean function is much easier.\nAnother example here is when we clean our column names, it is much easier to use the janitor::clean_names() function than to run the multiple lines of code using gsub()"

Declared using function().\nAnonymous Functions\nStill user defined - generally one line functions used within a larger piece of code, they have name, but still do specific tasks.\n\nIn this section we’re going to focus on User Defined functions."

When this is executed the function will stop at that line and return the given value.\n\nNo code after the return statement will be executed\n\nNote that the keyword return is not necessary; but any function without a return statement will return the final variable called - this is functionally the same as using a return statement, but more implicit and therefore less clear. If we do not give a variable to be returned, or state one at the end of our function we will get no value returned from our function. This could be useful in some cases, for example if you just want to print out some results to the console, or display a graph, without returning any data."

However, variables that have local scope are only visible inside their specific area and hence can only be used within that local scope.\nWhen we create a new function we effectively create a new local scope – so the variables we declare within our functions are only available within that local scope.\nHere is a classical example to demonstrate this.\n\n# Creating a function\n\nscope_function = function(){\n  # this variable is local to the \n  # scope_function and cannot be  \n  # accessed outside this function \n  weight_kg <- 60\n  \n} \n\n\n# To display the result\n# This will not work as z does not exist outside the function\n\nweight_kg\n\nThis will give the error message below,\nError: object ‘weight_kg’ not found"

    "text": "5.8 Arguments\nIn short, arguments are things you pass to a function, when you call it, to enable the function to perform it’s task.\n\n5.8.1 Required Arguments\nLike the name suggests, these are arguments which are required by a function and must be passed in the correct order.\n\n# Creating our function\n\narithmetic <- function(a, b) {\n  \n              return ((a ^ b) / b)\n}\n\n# Calling our function\n\narithmetic(a = 4, b = 9)\n\n[1] 29127.11\n\n\na and b are both required arguments. We would get a missing error if we did not pass both arguments.\n\n\n5.8.2 Default arguments\nThis is where, in the function declaration, the value of the parameter is pre-set. The function will retain this value unless it is changed when the function is called.\n\n# Creating our function\n\narithmetic <- function(a, b = 1) {\n  \n              return ((a ^ b) / b)\n}\n\n# Calling our function\n\narithmetic(a = 5)\n\n[1] 5\n\n# Calling our function overwriting the default value for b\n\narithmetic(a = 5, b = 2)\n\n[1] 12.5\n\n\nIn the first example above the function will take a = 5 and use the default value b = 1. Whereas, in the second example, we overwrite b = 1 by passing the argument 2.\n\n\n5.8.3 Dot-dot-dot arguments\nThis is also known as the ellipsis argument.\nYou will often see in list of arguments a function takes, in the documentation, this .... This is a special argument which captures any number of arguments that aren’t otherwise matched.\nSometimes being able to pass an arbitrary number of arguments can be useful, especially when another function is called within a wrapper function. This requires the ellipsis construct, …, which is designed to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.\nHere’s an example: We created this function earlier.\n\n# Creating our function\n                                          # Added ...\nfahrenheit_to_degrees_celsius <- function(fahrenheit, ...) {\n  \n  celsius <- (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32)\n  # Added round() with ...\n  celsius <- round(celsius, ...)\n  \n  return(celsius)\n}\n\nWe can use function as normally.\n\n# Calling the function\n\nfahrenheit_to_degrees_celsius(fahrenheit = 36)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe can also include a digits argument within this function which is coming from the round function.\n\n# Calling the function\n\nfahrenheit_to_degrees_celsius(fahrenheit = 36, digits = 4)\n\n[1] 2.2222"
